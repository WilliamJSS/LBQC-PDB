It is a biosynthetic form of human enzyme DNase I, produced in genetically modified CHO cells using recombinant DNA technology. The 260 amino acid synthetic sequence of dornase alfa is identical to the endogenous human enzyme. Dornase alfa cleaves extracellular DNA to 5´-phosphodinucleotide and 5´-phospho-oligonucleotide end products(without affecting intracellular DNA). In individuals with cystic fibrosis, extracellular DNA, an extremely viscous anion, is released by degenerating leukocytes which accumulate during inflammatory responses to infections. Enzymatic breakdown of this extracellular DNA causes reduction in sputum viscosity and viscoelasticity.	Used in the treatment of cystic fibrosis as adjunct therapy.	Cystic fibrosis (CF) is characterized by retention of viscous purulent secretions in the airways. These thick secretions contribute to reduced pulmonary function and to frequent pulmonary infection. Purulent pulmonary secretions of individuals with cystic fibrosis contain very high concentrations of extracellular DNA released by degenerating leukocytes that accumulate in response to these infections. Dornase alfa hydrolyzes the DNA in sputum of CF patients and reduces sputum viscosity and viscoelasticity. The enzyme does not appear to affect sputum in the absence of an inflammatory response to infection, nor does it affect the sputum of healthy individuals. 	Dornase alfa is a biosynthetic form of human DNase I. The enzyme is involved in endonucleolytic cleavage of extracellular DNA to 5´-phosphodinucleotide and 5´-phospho-oligonucleotide end products. It has no effect on intracellular DNA. Optimal activity dependent on the presence of divalent cations such as calcium and magnesium. Extracellular DNA is a viscous anionic polymer and its breakdown appears to improve the viscosity and viscoelasticity of purulent sputum of individuals with CF.

Normal renal function: 0.42 hours (in normal conditions)	Bivalirudin is a synthetic 20 residue peptide which acts as a thrombin inhibitor. Once bound to the active site of the inhibitor, thrombin cannot activate fibrinogen into fibrin which is a crucial step in the formation of thrombus. As it can cause blood stagnation, it is important to monitor changes in hematocrit, activated partial thromboplastin time, international normalized ratio and blood pressure. It is administered intravenously.	For treatment of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and for the prevention of thrombosis. Bivalirudin is indicated for use in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), in patients at moderate to high risk acute coronary syndromes due to unstable angina or non-ST segment elevation in whom a PCI is planned.	Bivalirudin directly and reversibly inhibits thrombin by specifically binding to both the catalytic site and the anion-binding exosite of circulating and clot-bound thrombin.  The action of bivalirudin is reversible as thrombin will slowly cleave the thrombin-bivalirudin bond which recovers the active site of thrombin. 	Inhibits the action of thrombin by binding to both its catalytic site and to its anion-binding exosite. Thrombin, a serine proteinase that plays a central role in the thrombotic process, acts to cleave fibrinogen into fibrin monomers and activate Factor XIII to Factor XIIIa, allowing fibrin to develop a covalently cross-linked framework which stabilizes the thrombus; thrombin also activates Factors V and VIII, promoting further thrombin generation, and activates platelets, stimulating aggregation and granule release.	Based on a study by Gleason et al., the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for bivalirudin administered to rats via Intravenous infusion over a 24-hour period, was 2000 mg/kg/24 h.	80% proteolytic cleavage	Bivalirudin exhibits linear pharmacokinetics.

Creatinine clearance 10-29mL/min: 0.95 hours	Bivalirudin is a synthetic 20 residue peptide which acts as a thrombin inhibitor. Once bound to the active site of the inhibitor, thrombin cannot activate fibrinogen into fibrin which is a crucial step in the formation of thrombus. As it can cause blood stagnation, it is important to monitor changes in hematocrit, activated partial thromboplastin time, international normalized ratio and blood pressure. It is administered intravenously.	For treatment of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and for the prevention of thrombosis. Bivalirudin is indicated for use in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), in patients at moderate to high risk acute coronary syndromes due to unstable angina or non-ST segment elevation in whom a PCI is planned.	Bivalirudin directly and reversibly inhibits thrombin by specifically binding to both the catalytic site and the anion-binding exosite of circulating and clot-bound thrombin.  The action of bivalirudin is reversible as thrombin will slowly cleave the thrombin-bivalirudin bond which recovers the active site of thrombin. 	Inhibits the action of thrombin by binding to both its catalytic site and to its anion-binding exosite. Thrombin, a serine proteinase that plays a central role in the thrombotic process, acts to cleave fibrinogen into fibrin monomers and activate Factor XIII to Factor XIIIa, allowing fibrin to develop a covalently cross-linked framework which stabilizes the thrombus; thrombin also activates Factors V and VIII, promoting further thrombin generation, and activates platelets, stimulating aggregation and granule release.

The average molecular weight of the PEG portion of the molecule is 12,000 daltons. The average molecular weight of the PEG-Intron molecule is approximately 31,000 daltons. The specific activity of peginterferon alfa-2b is approximately 0.7 x 108 IU/mg protein. Interferon alfa-2b is a water-soluble protein with a molecular weight of 19,271 daltons produced by recombinant DNA techniques. It is obtained from the bacterial fermentation of a strain of Escherichia coli bearing a genetically engineered plasmid containing an interferon gene from human leukocytes. The PEG strand protects the molecule in vivo from proteolytic breakdown, substantially increases its in vivo half-life, and reduces immunogenicity by wrapping around and physically hindering access to the protein portion of the molecule.	Used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C in patients not previously treated with interferon alpha who have compensated liver disease and are at least 18 years of age.

Normal cells, however, are able to synthesize asparagine and thus are affected less by the rapid depletion produced by treatment with the enzyme asparaginase. Elspar exploits a metabolic defect in asparagine synthesis of some malignant cells.	Asparaginase converts asparagine to aspartic acid and ammonia. It facilitates production of oxalo-acetate which is needed for general cellular metabolism. Some malignant cells lose the ability to produce asparagine and thus the loss of exogenous sources of asparagine leads to cell death.	N.A.	N.A.	N.A.	N.A.	N.A.	Antineoplastic Agents	N.A.	N.A.	N.A.

Anakinra is composed of 153 amino acid residues. FDA approved on November 14, 2001. 	To treat adult rheumatoid arthritis and Neonatal-Onset Multisystem Inflammatory Disease (NOMID).	Anakinra blocks the biologic activity of IL-1 by competitively inhibiting IL-1 binding to the interleukin-1 type I receptor (IL-1RI), which is expressed in a wide variety of tissues and organs. IL-1 production is induced in response to inflammatory stimuli and mediates various physiologic responses including inflammatory and immunological responses. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis have elevated levels of IL-1. The levels of the naturally occurring IL-1Ra in synovium and synovial fluid from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients are not sufficient to compete with the elevated amount of locally produced IL-1. Increasing the levels of IL-1Ra by artificial means reduces the negative effects (cartilage degradation, bone resorption) of IL-1.

Gramcidin D is a heterogeneous mixture of three antibiotic compounds, gramicidins A, B and C, making up 80%, 6%, and 14% respectively all of which are obtained from the soil bacterial species Bacillus brevis and called collectively gramicidin D.   Gramcidins are 15 residue peptides with alternating D and L amino acids.  The peptides assemble inside of the hydrophobic interior of the cellular lipid bilayer to form an alpha helix. The helix itself is not long enough to span the membrane but it dimerizes to form the elongated channel needed to span the whole membrane. Gramicidin D is used primarily as a topical antibiotic and is one of the three constituents of consumer antibiotic polysporin ophthalmic solution.	For treatment of skin lesions, surface wounds and eye infections	Gramicidin is particularly effective against gram-positive bacteria because the drug is highly hemolytic, it cannot be administered internally and so is used only on the skin as a lotion or ointment.

Intact IVIg and F(ab)2 fragments of IVIg can also neutralize the activity of various autoantibodies. By triggering the production of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, IVIg modulates of the production of cytokines and cytokine antagonists.

Insulin regular is a 51 residue peptide hormone, composed of two amino acid chains covalently linked by disulfide bonds. The structure is identical to native human insulin. Recombinant insulin is synthesized by recombinant DNA techncology. Inserting the human insulin gene into the Escherichia coli bacteria or Saccharomyces cerevisiae produces insulin for human use. 	Indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults and children with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus.	Insulin regular is a short-acting insulin. When subcutaneously administered, the onset of action (as evidenced by a decrease in glucose level) occurs 30 minutes post-dose. Maximal effect occurs between 1.5 and 3.5 hours post-dose. The glucose-lowering effect occurs 8 hours post-dose. Compared to other rapid-acting insulin analogs, insulin regular has a slower onset of action and longer duration of action. 	The primary activity of insulin is the regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulin promotes glucose and amino acid uptake into muscle and adipose tissues, and other tissues except brain and liver. It also has an anabolic role in stimulating glycogen, fatty  acid, and protein synthesis. Insulin inhibits gluconeogenesis in the liver. Insulin binds to the insulin receptor (IR), a heterotetrameric protein consisting of two extracellular alpha units and two transmembrane beta units. The binding of insulin to the alpha subunit of IR stimulates the tyrosine kinase activity intrinsic to the beta subunit of the receptor. The bound receptor is able to autophosphorylate and phosphorylate numerous intracellular substrates such as insulin receptor substrates (IRS) proteins, Cbl, APS, Shc and Gab 1. These activated proteins, in turn, lead to the activation of downstream signaling molecules including PI3 kinase and Akt.

Recombinant insulin is synthesized by recombinant DNA techncology. Inserting the human insulin gene into the Escherichia coli bacteria or Saccharomyces cerevisiae produces insulin for human use. 	Indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults and children with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus.	Insulin regular is a short-acting insulin. When subcutaneously administered, the onset of action (as evidenced by a decrease in glucose level) occurs 30 minutes post-dose. Maximal effect occurs between 1.5 and 3.5 hours post-dose. The glucose-lowering effect occurs 8 hours post-dose. Compared to other rapid-acting insulin analogs, insulin regular has a slower onset of action and longer duration of action. 	The primary activity of insulin is the regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulin promotes glucose and amino acid uptake into muscle and adipose tissues, and other tissues except brain and liver. It also has an anabolic role in stimulating glycogen, fatty  acid, and protein synthesis. Insulin inhibits gluconeogenesis in the liver. Insulin binds to the insulin receptor (IR), a heterotetrameric protein consisting of two extracellular alpha units and two transmembrane beta units. The binding of insulin to the alpha subunit of IR stimulates the tyrosine kinase activity intrinsic to the beta subunit of the receptor. The bound receptor is able to autophosphorylate and phosphorylate numerous intracellular substrates such as insulin receptor substrates (IRS) proteins, Cbl, APS, Shc and Gab 1. These activated proteins, in turn, lead to the activation of downstream signaling molecules including PI3 kinase and Akt. Akt regulates the activity of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and protein kinase C (PKC) which play a critical role in metabolism and catabolism.	Hypoglycemia is caused due to insulin toxicity.

Glucagon is a 29 residue peptide hormone, synthesized in a special non- pathogenic laboratory strain of Escherichia coli bacteria that has been genetically altered by the addition of the gene for glucagons.	Used to treat severe hypoglycemia, also used in gastrointestinal imaging.	Used in the treatment of hypoglycemia and in gastric imaging, glucagon increases blood glucose concentration and is used in the treatment of hypoglycemia. Glucagon acts only on liver glycogen, converting it to glucose through the release of insulin. It also relaxes the smooth muscles of the gastrointestinal tract.	Glucagon binds the glucagon receptor(G protein-coupled receptor located in the plasma membrane) which then initiates a dual signaling pathway using both adenylate cyclase activation and increased intracellular calcium. Adenylate cyclase manufactures cAMP (cyclic AMP), which activates protein kinase A (cAMP-dependent protein kinase). This enzyme, in turn, activates phosphorylase kinase, which, in turn, phosphorylates glycogen phosphorylase, converting into the active form called phosphorylase A. Phosphorylase A is the enzyme responsible for the release of glucose-1-phosphate from glycogen polymers. This yields glucose molecules to be released into the blood. Glucagon receptors are found in the liver, kidney, brain and pancreatic islet cells. The glucagon mediated signals lead to an increase in insulin excretion	N.A.	N.A.

Glucagon is a 29 residue peptide hormone, synthesized in a special non- pathogenic laboratory strain of Escherichia coli bacteria that has been genetically altered by the addition of the gene for glucagons.	Used to treat severe hypoglycemia, also used in gastrointestinal imaging.	Used in the treatment of hypoglycemia and in gastric imaging, glucagon increases blood glucose concentration and is used in the treatment of hypoglycemia. Glucagon acts only on liver glycogen, converting it to glucose through the release of insulin. It also relaxes the smooth muscles of the gastrointestinal tract.	Glucagon binds the glucagon receptor(G protein-coupled receptor located in the plasma membrane) which then initiates a dual signaling pathway using both adenylate cyclase activation and increased intracellular calcium. Adenylate cyclase manufactures cAMP (cyclic AMP), which activates protein kinase A (cAMP-dependent protein kinase). This enzyme, in turn, activates phosphorylase kinase, which, in turn, phosphorylates glycogen phosphorylase, converting into the active form called phosphorylase A. Phosphorylase A is the enzyme responsible for the release of glucose-1-phosphate from glycogen polymers. This yields glucose molecules to be released into the blood.

It is a heterodimeric glycoprotein. Each monomeric unit is a glycoprotein molecule. In females, an acute rise of LH(LH surge) triggers ovulation and the development of the corpus luteum. In males, it stimulates Leydig cell production of testosterone. Lutropin alfa was the first and only recombinant human form of luteinizing hormone (LH) developed for use in the stimulation of follicular development.	For treatment of female infertility	Used to facilitate female conception, lutropin alfa performs the same actions as luteinizing hormone, which is normally produced in the pituitary gland. Lutropin is usually given in combination with follitropin alfa. In females, a LH surge about halfway  through the menstrual cycle triggers the onset of ovulation. LH also induces the ovulated follicle to become a corpus luteum, which then secretes progesterone.	Binds to the luteinizing hormone receptor which then activates adenylate cylcase through G protein mediation.

Plasmid DNA transfected into the bacteria encodes for an analogue of human insulin that has a lysine at residuce B28 and proline at B29; these residues are reversed in endogenous human insulin. Reversal of these amino acid residues produces a rapid-acting insulin analogue. FDA approved on 1996. 	To treat type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus. To be used in conjunction with an intermediate or long-acting insulin except when used in a continuous insulin infusion pump.	Insulin is a natural hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas. In non-diabetic individuals, a basal level of insulin is supplemented with insulin spikes following meals. Increased insulin secretion following meals is responsible for the metabolic changes that occur as the body transitions from a postabsorptive to absorptive state. Insulin promotes cellular uptake of glucose, particularly in muscle and adipose tissues, promotes energy storage via glycogenesis, opposes catabolism of energy stores, increases DNA replication and protein synthesis by stimulating amino acid uptake by liver, muscle and adipose tissue, and modifies the activity of numerous enzymes involved in glycogen synthesis and glycolysis. Insulin also promotes growth and is required for the actions of growth hormone (e.g. protein synthesis, cell division, DNA synthesis). Insulin lispro is a rapid-acting insulin analogue used to mimic postprandial insulin spikes in diabetic individuals. The onset of action of insulin lispro is 10-15 minutes. Its activity peaks 60 minutes following subcutaneous injection and its duration of action is 4-5 hours. Compared to regular human insulin, insulin lispro  has a more rapid onset of action and a shorter duration of action. Insulin lispro is also shown to be equipotent to human insulin on a molar basis.  	Insulin lispro binds to the insulin receptor(IR), a heterotetrameric protein consisting of two extracellular alpha units and two transmembrane beta units. The binding of insulin to the alpha subunit of IR stimulates the tyrosine kinase activity intrinsic  to the beta subunit of the receptor. The bound receptor autophosphorylates and phosphorylates numerous intracellular substrates such as insulin receptor substrates (IRS) proteins, Cbl, APS, Shc and Gab 1. Activation of these proteins leads to the activation of downstream signaling molecules including PI3 kinase and Akt. Akt regulates the activity of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and protein kinase C (PKC), both of which play critical roles in metabolism and catabolism. In humans, insulin is stored in the form of hexamers; however, only insulin monomers are able to interact with IR. Reversal of the proline and lysine residues at positions B28 and B29 of native insulin eliminates hydrophobic interactions and weakens some of the hydrogen bonds that contribute to the stability of the insulin dimers that comprise insulin hexamers. Hexamers of insulin lispro are produced in the presence of zinc and -cresol. These weakly associated hexamers quickly dissociate upon subcutaneous injection and are absorbed as monomers through vascular endothelial cells. These properties give insulin lispro its fast-acting properties. 	Inappropriately high dosages relative to food intake and/or energy expenditure may result in severe and sometimes prolonged and life-threatening hypoglycemia. Neurogenic (autonomic) signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia include trembling, palpitations, sweat	Insulin is predominantly cleared by metabolic degradation via a receptor-mediated process.	Rapidly absorbed following subcutaneous administration. It is also absorbed more quickly than regular human insulin. Peak serum levels occur 30-90 minutes after injection in healthy subjects. Absorption also differs depending on the site of injection. Aft	When administered intravenously as bolus injections of 0.1 and 0.2 U/kg dose in two separate groups of healthy subjects, the mean volume of distribution of insulin lispro appeared to decrease with increase in dose (1.55 and 0.72 L/kg, respectively).

The binding of insulin to the alpha subunit of IR stimulates the tyrosine kinase activity intrinsic  to the beta subunit of the receptor. The bound receptor autophosphorylates and phosphorylates numerous intracellular substrates such as insulin receptor substrates (IRS) proteins, Cbl, APS, Shc and Gab 1. Activation of these proteins leads to the activation of downstream signaling molecules including PI3 kinase and Akt. Akt regulates the activity of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and protein kinase C (PKC), both of which play critical roles in metabolism and catabolism. In humans, insulin is stored in the form of hexamers; however, only insulin monomers are able to interact with IR. Reversal of the proline and lysine residues at positions B28 and B29 of native insulin eliminates hydrophobic interactions and weakens some of the hydrogen bonds that contribute to the stability of the insulin dimers that comprise insulin hexamers. Hexamers of insulin lispro are produced in the presence of zinc and -cresol. These weakly associated hexamers quickly dissociate upon subcutaneous injection and are absorbed as monomers through vascular endothelial cells. These properties give insulin lispro its fast-acting properties.

Insulin glargine is produced by recombinant DNA technology using a non-pathogenic laboratory strain of Escherichia coli (K12). It is an analogue of human insulin made by replacing the asparagine residue at position A21 of the A-chain with glycine and adding two arginines to the C-terminus (positions B31 and 32) of the B-chain. The resulting protein is soluble at pH 4 and forms microprecipitates at physiological pH 7.4. Small amounts of insulin glargine are slowly released from microprecipitates giving the drug a long duration of action (up to 24 hours) and no pronounced peak concentration. 	To treat Type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus in patients over 17 years old who require a long-acting (basal) insulin for the control of hyperglycemia. May be used in pediatric patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus who require a long-acting (basal) insulin for control of hyperglycemia. May be used in pediatric patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus who require a long-acting (basal) insulin for glycemic control. 	Insulin is a natural hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas. In non-diabetic individuals, a basal level of insulin is supplemented with insulin spikes following meals. Increased insulin secretion following meals is responsible for the metabolic changes that occur as the body transitions from a postabsorptive to absorptive state. Insulin promotes cellular uptake of glucose, particularly in muscle and adipose tissues, promotes energy storage via glycogenesis, opposes catabolism of energy stores, increases DNA replication and protein synthesis by stimulating amino acid uptake by liver, muscle and adipose tissue, and modifies the activity of numerous enzymes involved in glycogen synthesis and glycolysis. Insulin also promotes growth and is required for the actions of growth hormone (e.g. protein synthesis, cell division, DNA synthesis). Insulin lispro is a rapid-acting insulin analogue used to mimic postprandial insulin spikes in diabetic individuals. The onset of action of insulin lispro is 10-15 minutes. Its activity peaks 60 minutes following subcutaneous injection and its duration of action is 4-5 hours. Compared to regular human insulin, insulin lispro  has a more rapid onset of action and a shorter duration of action. Insulin lispro is also shown to be equipotent to human insulin on a molar basis.  	Insulin glargine binds to the insulin receptor, a heterotetrameric protein consisting of two extracellular alpha units and two transmembrane beta units. The binding of insulin to the alpha subunit of IR stimulates the tyrosine kinase activity intrinsic to the beta subunit of the receptor. The bound receptor autophosphorylates and phosphorylates numerous intracellular substrates such as insulin receptor substrates (IRS) proteins, Cbl, APS, Shc and Gab 1. Activation of these proteins leads to the activation of downstream signaling molecules including PI3 kinase and Akt. Akt regulates the activity of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and protein kinase C (PKC), both of which play critical roles in metabolism. Insulin glargine is completely soluble at pH 4, the pH of administered solution, and has low solubility at physiological pH 7.4. Upon subcuteous injection, the solution is neutralized resulting in the formation of microprecipitates. Small amounts of insulin glargine are released from microprecipitates giving the drug a relatively constant concentration over time profile over 24 hours with no pronounced peak. This release mechanism allows the drug to mimic basal insulin levels within the body.

The alpha- and beta- subunits have 92 and 111 amino acids. The alpha subunit is glycosylated at Asn 51 and Asn 78 while the beta subunit is glycosylated at Asn 7 and Asn 24. Follitropin beta is produced in genetically engineered Chinese hamster cell lines (CHO). The nomenclature â€œbetaâ€ differentiates it from another recombinant human FSH product that was marketed earlier as follitropin alpha. Follitropin is important in the development of follicles produced by the ovaries. Given by subcutaneous injection, it is used in combination with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) to assist in ovulation and fertility. Follitropin may also be used to cause the ovary to produce several follicles, which can then be harvested for use in gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT) or in vitro fertilization (IVF).  Numerous physio-chemical tests and bioassays indicate that follitropin beta and follitropin alpha are indistinguishable. However, a more recent study showed there is may be a slight clinical difference, with the alpha form tending towards a higher pregnancy rate and the beta form tending towards a lower pregnancy rate, but with significantly higher estradiol (E2) levels.  Structural analysis shows that the amino acid sequence of follitropin beta is identical to that of natural human follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). Further, the ogliosaccharide side chains are very similar, but not completely identical to that of natural FSH. However, these small differences do not affect the bioactivity compared to natural FSH.	For treatment of female infertility	Used for the treatment of female infertility, Follitropin beta or follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) stimulates ovarian follicular growth in women who do not have primary ovarian failure. FSH, the active component of Follitropin beta is the primary hormone responsible for follicular recruitment and development.	Follitropin alpha is a recombinant form of endogenous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). FSH binds to the follicle stimulating hormone receptor which is a G-coupled transmembrane receptor. Binding of the FSH to its receptor seems to induce phosphorylation and activation of the PI3K (Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase) and Akt signaling pathway, which is known to regulate many other metabolic and related survival/maturation functions in cells.

Follicle-stimulating hormone receptor	Follistim AQ	Merck	Follistim AQ (follitropin beta injection) contains human follicle-stimulating hormone (hFSH), a glycoprotein hormone which is manufactured by recombinant DNA (rDNA) technology. The active drug substance, follitropin beta, has a dimeric structure containing two glycoprotein subunits (alpha and beta). Both the 92 amino acid alpha-chain and the 111 amino acid beta-chain have complex heterogeneous structures arising from two N-linked oligosaccharide chains. Follitropin beta is synthesized in a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line that has been transfected with a plasmid containing the two subunit DNA sequences encoding for hFSH.	Follistim AQ (follitropin beta injection) is indicated for the development of multiple follicles in ovulatory patients participating in an Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) program. Follistim AQ (follitropin beta) is also indicated for the induction of ovulation and pregnancy in anovulatory infertile patients in whom the cause of infertility is functional and not due to primary ovarian failure.	N.A.	Each single-use vial of Follistim AQ (follitropin beta) contains the following per 0.5 mL: 75 IU or 150 IU of FSH activity; 25 mg sucrose, NF; 7.35 mg sodium citrate (dihydrate), USP; 0.25 mg L-methionine, USP; 0.1 mg polysorbate 20, NF; and water for injection, USP. Hydrochloric acid, NF and/or sodium hydroxide, NF are used to adjust the pHto 7.	Follistim AQ (follitropin beta) is presented as a Sterile aqueous solution 	for Subcutaneous or INTRAMUSubcutaneousULAR administration	starting dose of 150 to 225 IU of Follistim AQ (follitropin beta injection) is recommended for at least the first four days of treatment.

The alpha- and beta- subunits have 92 and 111 amino acids. The alpha subunit is glycosylated at Asn 51 and Asn 78 while the beta subunit is glycosylated at Asn 7 and Asn 24. Follitropin beta is produced in genetically engineered Chinese hamster cell lines (CHO). The nomenclature â€œbetaâ€ differentiates it from another recombinant human FSH product that was marketed earlier as follitropin alpha. Follitropin is important in the development of follicles produced by the ovaries. Given by subcutaneous injection, it is used in combination with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) to assist in ovulation and fertility. Follitropin may also be used to cause the ovary to produce several follicles, which can then be harvested for use in gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT) or in vitro fertilization (IVF).  Numerous physio-chemical tests and bioassays indicate that follitropin beta and follitropin alpha are indistinguishable. However, a more recent study showed there is may be a slight clinical difference, with the alpha form tending towards a higher pregnancy rate and the beta form tending towards a lower pregnancy rate, but with significantly higher estradiol (E2) levels.  Structural analysis shows that the amino acid sequence of follitropin beta is identical to that of natural human follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). Further, the ogliosaccharide side chains are very similar, but not completely identical to that of natural FSH. However, these small differences do not affect the bioactivity compared to natural FSH.	For treatment of female infertility	Used for the treatment of female infertility, Follitropin beta or follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) stimulates ovarian follicular growth in women who do not have primary ovarian failure. FSH, the active component of Follitropin beta is the primary hormone responsible for follicular recruitment and development.	Follitropin alpha is a recombinant form of endogenous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). FSH binds to the follicle stimulating hormone receptor which is a G-coupled transmembrane receptor. Binding of the FSH to its receptor seems to induce phosphorylation and activation of the PI3K (Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase) and Akt signaling pathway, which is known to regulate many other metabolic and related survival/maturation functions in cells.

Antidiuretic hormone binds to receptors in the distal or collecting tubules of the kidney and promotes reabsorbtion of water back into the circulation.	For the treatment of enuresis, polyuria, diabetes insipidus, polydipsia and oesophageal varices with bleeding	Vasopressin is an antidiuretic hormone indicated for the prevention and treatment of postoperative abdominal distention, in abdominal roentgenography to dispel interfering gas shadows, and in diabetes insipidus. Vasopressin can cause contraction of smooth muscle of the gastrointestinal tract and of all parts of the vascular bed, especially the capillaries, small arterioles and venules. It has less effect on the smooth musculature of the large veins. Vasopressin may also be used to control bleeding in some forms of von Willebrand disease and to treat extreme cases of bed wetting in children. It may also play a role in memory formation although the mechanism is unknown.	Vasopressin acts on three different receptors, vasopressin receptor V1a (which initiates vasoconstriction, liver gluconeogenesis, platelet aggregation and release of factor VIII), vasopressin receptor V1b (which mediates corticotrophin secretion from the pituitary) and vasopressin receptor V2 which controls free water reabsorption in the renal medullar. The binding of vasopressin to the V2 receptor activates adenylate cyclase which causes the release of aquaporin 2 channels into the cells lining the renal medullar duct. This allows water to be reabsorbed down an osmotic gradient so the urine is more concentrated.	N.A.

Betaferon may change the course of your MS. It helps to reduce the frequency, severity and duration of any relapses you may have and can help to slow down the progression of the disease. It has been taken by people with MS for more than 16 years, and there is a wealth of data showing both its effectiveness and safety profile in a broad range of people.	Betaferon is indicated for the treatment of patients with a single demyelinating event with an active inflammatory process, if it is severe enough to warrant treatment with intravenous corticosteroids, if alternative diagnoses have been excluded, and if they are determined to be at high risk of developing clinically definite multiple sclerosis; patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and two or more relapses within the last two years; patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis with active disease, evidenced by relapses.

Composed of alpha and beta chains, processed from pro-insulin. Forms a hexameric structure.	For the treatment of type I and II diabetes mellitus.	Insulin is used in the treatment of type I and type II diabetes. The primary activity of insulin is the regulation of glucose metabolism. In muscle and other tissues (except the brain), insulin causes rapid transport of glucose and amino acids intracellularly. It also promotes anabolism, and inhibits protein catabolism. In the liver, insulin promotes the uptake and storage of glucose in the form of glycogen, inhibits gluconeogenesis, and promotes the conversion of excess glucose into fat.	Insulin binds to the insulin receptor (IR), a heterotetrameric protein consisting of two extracellular alpha units and two transmembrane beta units. The binding of insulin to the alpha subunit of IR stimulates the tyrosine kinase activity intrinsic to the beta subunit of the receptor. The bound receptor is able to autophosphorylate and phosphorylate numerous intracellular substrates such as insulin receptor substrates (IRS) proteins, Cbl, APS, Shc and Gab 1. These activated proteins, in turn, lead to the activation of downstream signaling molecules including PI3 kinase and Akt.

DIGIBIND	Galaxo Smith Kline	DIGIBIND, Digoxin Immune Fab (Ovine), is a sterile lyophilized powder of antigen binding fragments (Fab) derived from specific antidigoxin antibodies raised in sheep. Production of antibodies specific for digoxin involves conjugation of digoxin as a hapten to human albumin. Sheep are immunized with this material to produce antibodies specific for the antigenic determinants of the digoxin molecule. The antibody is then papain-digested and digoxin-specific Fab fragments of the antibody are isolated and purified by affinity chromatography. These antibody fragments have a molecular weight of approximately 46,200.	DIGIBIND, Digoxin Immune Fab (Ovine), is indicated for treatment of potentially life-threatening digoxin intoxication. Although designed specifically to treat life-threatening digoxin overdose, it has also been used successfully to treat life-threatening digitoxin overdose. Since human experience is limited and the consequences of repeated exposures are unknown, DIGIBIND is not indicated for milder cases of digitalis toxicity.	N.A.

N.A.	7 days	Daptomycin is a lipopeptide antibiotic that kills susceptible gram positive bacteria by disrupting their membrane potential. It is a naturally-occurring compound found in the soil bacterium &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces roseosporus&lt;/i&gt;. Antibiotics are used in the treatment of infections caused by bacteria. They work by killing bacteria or preventing their growth. Daptomycin will not work for colds, flu, or other virus infections. It was approved in September 2003 for the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections. It has a safety profile similar to other agents commonly administered to treat gram-positive infections.	For the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections caused by susceptible strains of Gram-positive microorganisms.	Daptomycin is a 13 member amino acid cyclic lipopeptide antibiotic active against Gram-positive bacteria only. It has proven in vitro activity against enterococci (including glycopeptide-resistant Enterococci (GRE)), staphylococci (including methicillin-resistant &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt;), streptococci and corynebacteria. Daptomycin is derived from the fermentation product of Streptomyces roseosporus. &#13;	Daptomycin appears to bind or insert into the outer membrane of gram positive bacteria. The binding and integration of daptomycin into the cell membrane is calcium dependent. Calcium ions cause a conformational change in daptomycin, augmenting its amphipathicity (hydrophilic head group and hydrophobic tail group), leading to incorporation into the cell membrane.&#13; This binding causes rapid depolarisation, resulting in a loss of membrane potential leading to inhibition of protein, DNA and RNA synthesis, which results in bacterial cell death. The bactericidal activity of daptomycin is concentration-dependent. There is in vitro evidence of synergy with β-lactam antibiotics.	N.A.

Neupogen by Amgen. Amino acid sequence is identical to the natural sequence predicted in human genome, with the exception of an N-terminal methionine to aid expression in E coli. Tbo-filgrastim, which is marketed by Sicor Biotech and FDA approved on August 29, 2012, contains the same active ingredient as Neupogen and is biologically similar, but it is formulated to be short-acting.	Filgrastim is used in patients with acute myeloid leukemia receiving induction or consolidation chemotherapy. It is also used in cancer patients receiving bone marrow transplant. In general, filgrastim increases neutrophil counts in order to decrease the risk of infection or duration of neutropenia in the aforementioned patient populations. Infection and neutropenia are adverse events associated with chemotherapy. Furthermore, filgrastim is also indicated for patients with severe chronic neutropenia. It mobilizes hematopoietic progenitor cells into the peripheral blood for collection by leukapheresis to allow for a more rapid engraftment. Tbo-filgrastim has a narrower indication profile than Neupogen - it is a leukocyte growth factor indicated for the reduction in the duration of severe neutropenia in patients with non-myeloid malignancies.	Used in the treatment of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia by enhancing the production of neutrophils. Filgrastim acts on hematopoietic cells by binding to specific cell surface receptors thereby stimulating proliferation, differentiation, commitment, and end cell functional activation. When tbo-filgrastim is administered to cancer patients, it took 3-5 days to reach maximum absolute neutrophil count (ANC). Levels of neutrophils returned to baseline by 21 days following completion of chemotherapy. In the healthy volunteer trials, doubling the tbo-filgrastim subcutaneous dose from 5 to 10 mcg/kg resulted in a 16-19% increase in the ANCmax and a 33-36% increase in the area under the effect curve for ANC.	Filgrastim binds to the G-CSF receptor and stimulates the production of neutrophils in the bone marrow. As a G-CSF analog, it controls proliferation of committed progenitor cells and influences their maturation into mature neutrophils. Filgrastim also stimulates the release of neutrophils from bone marrow storage pools and reduces their maturation time. Filgrastim acts to increase the phagocytic activity of mature neutrophils. In patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy, Filgrastim can accelerate neutrophil recovery, leading to a reduction in duration of the neutropenic phase	N.A.	N.A.

Neupogen by Amgen. Amino acid sequence is identical to the natural sequence predicted in human genome, with the exception of an N-terminal methionine to aid expression in E coli. Tbo-filgrastim, which is marketed by Sicor Biotech and FDA approved on August 29, 2012, contains the same active ingredient as Neupogen and is biologically similar, but it is formulated to be short-acting.	Filgrastim is used in patients with acute myeloid leukemia receiving induction or consolidation chemotherapy. It is also used in cancer patients receiving bone marrow transplant. In general, filgrastim increases neutrophil counts in order to decrease the risk of infection or duration of neutropenia in the aforementioned patient populations. Infection and neutropenia are adverse events associated with chemotherapy. Furthermore, filgrastim is also indicated for patients with severe chronic neutropenia. It mobilizes hematopoietic progenitor cells into the peripheral blood for collection by leukapheresis to allow for a more rapid engraftment. Tbo-filgrastim has a narrower indication profile than Neupogen - it is a leukocyte growth factor indicated for the reduction in the duration of severe neutropenia in patients with non-myeloid malignancies.	Used in the treatment of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia by enhancing the production of neutrophils. Filgrastim acts on hematopoietic cells by binding to specific cell surface receptors thereby stimulating proliferation, differentiation, commitment, and end cell functional activation. When tbo-filgrastim is administered to cancer patients, it took 3-5 days to reach maximum absolute neutrophil count (ANC). Levels of neutrophils returned to baseline by 21 days following completion of chemotherapy. In the healthy volunteer trials, doubling the tbo-filgrastim subcutaneous dose from 5 to 10 mcg/kg resulted in a 16-19% increase in the ANCmax and a 33-36% increase in the area under the effect curve for ANC.	Filgrastim binds to the G-CSF receptor and stimulates the production of neutrophils in the bone marrow. As a G-CSF analog, it controls proliferation of committed progenitor cells and influences their maturation into mature neutrophils. Filgrastim also stimulates the release of neutrophils from bone marrow storage pools and reduces their maturation time. Filgrastim acts to increase the phagocytic activity of mature neutrophils.

Sequence  is identical to the A148 allelic form of plasma-derived factor IX.	For treatment of hemophilia (Christmas disease).	Binds vitamin K and factor VIIIa. Cleaves the Arg-Ile bond in factor X to form active factor Xa. Plays a key role in blood coagulation and clotting. Injections of factor IX are used to treat hemophilia B, which is sometimes called Christmas disease. AlphaNine is injected to increase plasma levels of Factor IX and can temporarily correct this coagulation defect.	Coagulation Factor IX is an important protein in the process of hemostasis and normal blood clotting. Factor IX is plays an important intermediate role in the blood coagulation cascade. It is located within the blood plasma as a zymogen, an antecedent to enzymatic function, in its inactivated state. Factor IX is dependent on the presence of Vitamin K, and is activated to a serine protease by the function of Coagulation Factor XIa. Factor XIa cleaves the peptide bond associated with protein activation in Factor IX, leaving Factor IX with two exposed chains, a light chain and a heavy chain. These two chains are held together by several disulfide bonds that reinforce the structure of Factor IX's activated form. After being activated, Factor IX forms a complex with calcium ions, membrane phospholipids and Coagulation Factor VIII to activate Coagulation Factor X. The activation of Factor X then performs a similarly integral step in the blood coagulation cascade. The ultimate result of phenotypically normal coagulation factors is the creation of platelets for normal blood clotting.	N.A.	N.A.	N.A.	N.A.	N.A.	Coagulants and Thrombotic Agents	N.A.	N.A.	N.A.	N.A.

For the treatment of patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) to reduce hemolysis.	Eculizumab is a monoclonal antibody directed against the complement protein C5. This antibody blocks the cleavage of C5 and halts the process of complement-mediated cell destruction. Eculizumab is a product of Alexion Pharmaceuticals and has been shown to be effective in treating paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. Eculizumab was approved by the FDA in March, 2007.	A genetic mutation in PNH patients leads to the generation of populations of abnormal RBCs (known as PNH cells) that are deficient in terminal complement inhibitors (CD-59), rendering PNH RBCs sensitive to persistent terminal complement-mediated destruction. The destruction and loss of these PNH cells (intravascular hemolysis) results in low RBC counts (anemia) and also fatigue, difficulty in functioning, pain, dark urine, shortness of breath, and blood clots. Eculizumab, the active ingredient in Soliris, is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the complement protein C5 specifically and with high affinity, thereby inhibiting its cleavage to C5a and C5b and subsequent generation of the terminal complement complex C5b-9. Soliris inhibits terminal complement mediated intravascular hemolysis in PNH patients and therefore the destruction of PNH erythrocytes that lack complement protection with CD-59.	N.A.	N.A.

It is a recombinant human IgG2 monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to the human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).	For the treatment of EGFR-expressing, metastatic colorectal carcinoma that is refractory to fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan- containing chemotherapy regimens.	Panitumumab is a recombinant, human IgG2 kappa monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to the human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR). EGFR is a transmembrane glycoprotein that belongs to the subfamily of type I receptor tyrosine kinases. Although EGFR is expressed in normal cells, the overexpression of EGFR is detected in many human cancers, including those of the colon and rectum. Interaction of EGFR with its normal ligands causes phosphorylation and activation of a series of intracellular proteins that will in turn regulate the transcription of genes involved with cellular growth and survival, motility, and prolieration. Signal transduction through EGFR leads to the activation of the wild type KRAS gene, but the presence of an activating somatic mutation of the KRAS gene within a cancer cell can result in the dysregulation of signaling pathways and resistance to EGFR inhibitor therapy.	Panitumumab binds specifically to EGFR on both normal and tumor cells, and competitively inhibits the binding of ligands for EGFR. Nonclinical studies show that binding of panitumumab to the EGFR prevents ligand-induced receptor autophosphorylation and activation of receptor-associated kinases, resulting in inhibition of cell growth, induction of apoptosis, decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine and vascular growth factor production, and internalization of the EGFR.	Panitumumab was shown to cause skin, ocular and mucosal related toxicities in 90% of patients receiving panitumumab.

Ranibizumab is a recombinant humanized IgG1 kappa isotype monoclonal antibody fragment designed for intraocular use. Ranibizumab is a VEGF-A antagonist that binds to and inhibits the biologic activity of active forms of human VEGF-A, including the cleaved form (VEGF110). VEGF-A has been shown to cause neovascularization (angiogenesis) and an increase in vascular permeability, which is thought to contribute to the progression of the neovascular form of age-related macular degeneration (AMD).

Idursulfase is a 525-amino acid glycoprotein, which contains 8 N-linked glycosylation sites, occupied by complex oligosaccharide structures. Its enzyme activity depends on the post-translational modification of a specific cysteine to formylglycine.	For the treatment of Hunter syndrome in adults and children ages 5 and older.	Idursulfase is a purified form of the lysosomal enzyme human iduronate-2-sulfatase of recombinant DNA origin. It is designed to replace the natural enzyme, increasing catabolism of certain accumulated glycosaminoglycans (GAG), which abnormally accumulate in multiple tissue types in patients with mucopolysaccharidosis II (MPS-II, or Hunter syndrome).	Hunter's Syndrome is an X-linked recessive disease caused by insufficient levels of the lysosomal enzyme iduronate-2-sulfatase. This enzyme cleaves the terminal 2-O-sulfate moieties from the glycosaminoglycans (GAG) dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate. Due to the missing or defective iduronate-2-sulfatase enzyme in patients with Hunter's Syndrome, GAG progressively accumulate in the lysosomes of a variety of cells, leading to cellular engorgement, organomegaly, tissue destruction and organ system dysfunction. Treatment of Hunter's Syndrome patients with idursulfase provides exogenous enzyme for uptake into cellular lysosomes. Targeting of idursulfase to the lysosome occurs by endocytosis from the cell surface. Mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) residues on the oligosaccharide chains allow specific binding of the enzymes to the M6P receptors on the cell surface, leading to cellular internalization of the enzyme, targeting to intracellular lysosomes and subsequent catabolism of accumulated GAG.	There is no experience with overdosage of Idursulfase in humans. Single intravenous doses of idursulfase up to 20 mg/kg were not lethal in male rats and cynomolgus monkeys (approximately 6.5 and 13 times, respectively, of the recommended human dose based on body surface area) and there were no clinical signs of toxicity.

The mature polypeptide is 883 residue long with a mass of 98,008 daltons and a total mass of approximately 109,000 daltons of the full-length glycosylated protein	For the treatment of Pompe disease (GAA deficiency) in infants and pediatric patients.	Pompe disease (glycogen storage disease type II, GSD II, glycogenosis type II, acid maltase deficiency) is an inherited disorder of glycogen metabolism caused by the absence or marked deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme GAA. In the infantile-onset form, Pompe disease results in intralysosomal accumulation of glycogen in various tissues, particularly cardiac and skeletal muscles, and hepatic tissues, leading to the development of cardiomyopathy, progressive muscle weakness, and impairment of respiratory function. In the juvenile- and adult-onset forms, intralysosomal accumulation of glycogen is limited primarily to skeletal muscle, resulting in progressive muscle weakness. Death in all forms is usually related to respiratory failure. Alglucosidase alfa provides an exogenous source of GAA. Binding to mannose-6-phosphate receptors on the cell surface has been shown to occur via carbohydrate groups on the GAA molecule, after which it is internalized and transported into lysosomes, where it undergoes proteolytic cleavage that results in increased enzymatic activity. It then exerts enzymatic activity in cleaving glycogen.	Alglucosidase alfa is designed to act as an exogenous source of GAA, acting to correct GAA deficiency that is the hallmark of Pompe disease. Alglucosidase alfa binds to mannose-6-phosphate receptors on the cell surface via carbohydrate groups on the GAA molecule, after which it is internalized and transported into lysosomes, where it undergoes proteolytic cleavage that results in increased enzymatic activity.

Derived from a compound found in the saliva of the Gila monster, a large lizard native to the southwestern United States. It is a functional analog of Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) peptide.	Indicated as adjunctive therapy to improve glycemic control in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus who are taking metformin, a sulfonylurea, or a combination of both, but have not achieved adequate glycemic control.	Exenatide is an incretin mimetic, which has glucoregulatory effects. While it is has blood-sugar lowering actions alone, it can also be combined with other medications such as pioglitazone, metformin, sulfonylureas, and/or insulin to improve glucose control. The approved use of exenatide is with either sulfonylureas, metformin and thiazolinediones. The medication is injected twice per day using a pre-filled pen device. Typical human responses to exenatide plus eating include improvements in the initial rapid release of endogenous insulin, suppression of glucagon release by the pancreas, regulation of gastric empyting and reduced appetite; all behaviors more typical of individuals without blood sugar control problems. Exenatide is self-regulating in that in lowers blood sugar when levels are elevated but does not continue to lower blood sugar when levels return to normal, unlike with sulfonylureas or insulins.	Exenatide is a functional analog of the human incretin Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1). Incretins enhance glucose-dependent insulin secretion and exhibit other antihyperglycemic actions following their release into the circulation from the gut. The GLP-1 system increases insulin secretion only in the presence of elevated plasma glucose levels, avoiding inappropriately high insulin levels during fasting. The drug also moderates peak serum glucagon levels during hyperglycemic periods following meals, but does not interfere with glucagon release in response to hypoglycemia. Secondary effects of drug administration reduces the rate of gastric emptying and decreases food intake, mitigating the potential severity of hyperglycemic events after meals.	Effects of the overdoses included severe nausea, severe vomiting, and rapidly declining blood glucose concentrations.	N.A.

For the treatment of type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus as an adjunct to preprandial insulin therapy in patients without adequate glycemic control of insulin therapy.	Pramlintide is a synthetic analog of amylin, a glucoregulatory hormone that is synthesized by pancreatic Î²-cells and released into the bloodstream, in a similar pattern as insulin, after a meal. Like insulin, amylin is deficient in individuals with diabetes. It is provided as an acetate salt.

Pramlintide is a synthetic analog of human amylin, a naturally occurring neuroendocrine hormone synthesized by pancreatic beta cells that contributes to glucose control during the postprandial period. Pramlintide is provided as an acetate salt of the synthetic 37-amino acid polypeptide, which differs in amino acid sequence from human amylin by replacement with proline at positions 25 (alanine), 28 (serine), and 29 (serine). The structural formula of pramlintide acetate is shown below: Lys-Cys-Asn-Thr-Ala-Thr-Cys-Ala-Thr-Gln-Arg-Leu-Ala-Asn-Phe-Leu-Val-His-Ser-Ser-AsnAsn-Phe-Gly-Pro-Ile-Leu-Pro-Pro-Thr-Asn-Val-Gly-Ser-Asn-Thr-Tyr-NH2 acetate (salt) with a disulfide bridge between the two Cys residues. Pramlintide acetate is a white powder that has a molecular formula of C171H267N51O53S2• × C2H4O2 (3 ≤ × ≤ 8); the molecular weight is 3949.4. Pramlintide acetate is soluble in water.	SYMLIN is indicated as an adjunctive treatment in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes who use mealtime insulin therapy and who have failed to achieve desired glucose control despite optimal insulin therapy.	N.A.	The disposable multidose SymlinPen pen-injector contains 1000 mcg/mL of pramlintide (as acetate). The formulation contains 2.25 mg/mL of metacresol as a preservative, D-mannitol as a tonicity modifier, acetic acid, sodium acetate as pH modifiers, and water for injection. SYMLIN has a pH of approximately 4.0	Clear, isotonic, sterile solution for subcutaneous administration	Subcutaneous	Reduce mealtime insulin doses by 50%, then initiate SYMLIN at 15 mcg subcutaneously, injecting immediately prior to each major meal. Increase the SYMLIN dose to the next increment (30, 45, or 60 mcg) when no clinically significant nausea has occurred for at least 3 days. If significant nausea persists at the 45 or 60 mcg dose level, the SYMLIN dose should be decreased to 30 mcg. If the 30 mcg dose is not tolerated, discontinuation of SYMLIN therapy should be considered.	N.A.

All three complexes contain the calcitonin receptor at the core, plus one of three Receptor activity-modifying proteins, RAMP1, RAMP2, or RAMP3.	N.A.	Metabolized primarily by the kidneys.

A recombinant variant form of the polymorphic human enzyme, N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfatase. It is a glycoprotein with a molecular weight of approximately 56 kD and comprises 495 amino acids. It contains 6 N-linked glycosylation sites, four of which carry a bis-mannose-6-phosphate manose7 oligosaccharide for specific cellular recognition. It requires Ca-formylglycine for its catalytic activity. This residue is a post-translational modification of Cys53 and conserved in all members of the sulfatase enzyme family.	For the treatment of adults and children with Mucopolysaccharidosis VI.	Mucopolysaccharide storage disorders are caused by the deficiency of specific lysosomal enzymes required for the catabolism of GAG. Mucopolysaccharidosis VI (MPS VI, Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome) is characterized by the absence or marked reduction in N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfatase. The sulfatase activity deficiency results in the accumulation of the GAG substrate dermatan sulfate, throughout the body. This accumulation leads to widespread cellular, tissue, and organ dysfunction. Galsulfase is intended to provide an exogenous enzyme that will be taken up into lysosomes and increase the catabolism of GAG. Galsulfase uptake by cells into lysosomes is most likely mediated by the binding of mannose-6-phosphate-terminated oligosaccharide chains of galsulfase to specific mannose-6-phosphate receptors.	Galsulfase supplies recombinant-engineered galsulfase, a normal variant form of the polymorphic human enzyme, N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfatase. It is a lysosomal hydrolase that catalyzes the cleavage of the sulfate ester from terminal N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfate residues of GAG chondroitin 4-sulfate and dermatan sulfate. Increased catabolism of GAG in turn reduces systemic dermatan sulfate accumulation, thereby reducing the primary symptoms of MPS VI.	There is no experience with overdose of galsulfase.	N.A.	N.A.	N.A.

Dermatan sulfate,Perilipin-3	Naglazyme	BioMarin	NAGLAZYME is a formulation of galsulfase, which is a purified human enzyme that is produced by recombinant DNA technology in a Chinese hamster ovary cell line. Galsulfase (glycosaminoglycan N–acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfatase, EC 3.1.6.12) is a lysosomal enzyme that catalyzes the cleavage of the sulfate ester from terminal N–acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfate residues of glycosaminoglycans (GAG), chondroitin 4-sulfate and dermatan sulfate. Galsulfase is a glycoprotein with a molecular weight of approximately 56 kDa. The recombinant protein consists of 495 amino acids and possesses six asparagine-linked glycosylation sites, four of which carry a bis-mannose–6–phosphate residue for specific cellular recognition. Post-translational modification of Cys53 produces the catalytic amino acid residue, Cα-formylglycine, which is required for enzyme activity. NAGLAZYME has a specific activity of approximately 70 units per mg of protein content. One activity unit is defined as the amount of enzyme required to convert 1 micromole of 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate to 4-methylumbelliferone and free sulfate per minute at 37°C.

Abatacept is a glycosylated fusion protein with molecular weight of 92,300 Da and it is a homodimer of two polypeptide chains of 357 amino acids. The drug has activity as a selective co-stimulation modulator with inhibitory activity on T lymphocytes.	For the management of the signs and symptoms of moderate-to-severe active rheumatoid arthritis, inducing major clinical response, slowing the progression of structural damage, and improving physical function in adult patients. It is indicated both as a monotherapy and for use in combination with a continued regimen of DMARDs (not including TNF antagonists). Also used for the management of the signs and symptoms of moderately to severely active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in children.	Abatacept is the first in a new class of drugs known as Selective Co-stimulation Modulators. Known as a recombinant fusion protein, the drug consists of the extracellular domain of human cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) linked to a modified Fc portion of human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1. The Fc portion of the drug consists of the hinge region, the CH2 domain, and the CH3 domain of IgG1. Although there are multiple pathways and cell types involved in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis, evidence suggests that T-cell activation may play an important role in the immunopathology of the disease. Ordinarily, full T-cell activation requires binding of the T-cell receptor to an antigen-MHC complex on the antigen-presenting cell as well as a co-stimulatory signal provided by the binding of the CD28 protein on the surface of the T-cell with the CD80/86 proteins on the surface of the antigen-presenting cell. CTLA4 is a naturally occurring protein which is expressed on the surface of T-cells some hours or days after full T-cell activation and is capable of binding to CD80/86 on antigen-presenting cells with much greater affinity than CD28. Binding of CTLA4-Ig to CD80/86 provides a negative feedback mechanism which results in T-cell deactivation. Abatacept was developed by Bristol-Myers-Squibb and is licensed in the US for the treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis in the case of inadequate response to anti-TNF-alpha therapy.	Abatacept is a selective costimulation modulator, like CTLA-4, the drug has shown to inhibit T-cell (T lymphocyte) activation by binding to CD80 and CD86, thereby blocking interaction with CD28. Blockade of this interaction has been shown to inhibit the delivery of the second co-stimulatory signal required for optimal activation of T-cells. This results in the inhibition of autoimmune T-Cell activation that has been implcated in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis.

For the management of the signs and symptoms of moderate-to-severe active rheumatoid arthritis, inducing major clinical response, slowing the progression of structural damage, and improving physical function in adult patients. It is indicated both as a monotherapy and for use in combination with a continued regimen of DMARDs (not including TNF antagonists). Also used for the management of the signs and symptoms of moderately to severely active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in children.	Abatacept is the first in a new class of drugs known as Selective Co-stimulation Modulators. Known as a recombinant fusion protein, the drug consists of the extracellular domain of human cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) linked to a modified Fc portion of human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1. The Fc portion of the drug consists of the hinge region, the CH2 domain, and the CH3 domain of IgG1. Although there are multiple pathways and cell types involved in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis, evidence suggests that T-cell activation may play an important role in the immunopathology of the disease. Ordinarily, full T-cell activation requires binding of the T-cell receptor to an antigen-MHC complex on the antigen-presenting cell as well as a co-stimulatory signal provided by the binding of the CD28 protein on the surface of the T-cell with the CD80/86 proteins on the surface of the antigen-presenting cell. CTLA4 is a naturally occurring protein which is expressed on the surface of T-cells some hours or days after full T-cell activation and is capable of binding to CD80/86 on antigen-presenting cells with much greater affinity than CD28. Binding of CTLA4-Ig to CD80/86 provides a negative feedback mechanism which results in T-cell deactivation. Abatacept was developed by Bristol-Myers-Squibb and is licensed in the US for the treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis in the case of inadequate response to anti-TNF-alpha therapy.	Abatacept is a selective costimulation modulator, like CTLA-4, the drug has shown to inhibit T-cell (T lymphocyte) activation by binding to CD80 and CD86, thereby blocking interaction with CD28. Blockade of this interaction has been shown to inhibit the delivery of the second co-stimulatory signal required for optimal activation of T-cells. This results in the inhibition of autoimmune T-Cell activation that has been implcated in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis.	Most common adverse events (≥10%) are headache, upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis, and nausea. Doses up to 50 mg/kg have been administered without apparent toxic effect.	N.A.	When a single 10 mg/kg Intravenous infusion of abatacept is administered in healthy subjects, the peak plasma concentration (Cmax) was 292 mcg/mL. When multiple doses of 10 mg/kg was given to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, the Cmax was 295 mcg/mL.

This segment is similar in all species and responsible for biological activity.	For use as a diagnostic agent in the screening of patients presumed to have adrenocortical insufficiency.	Cosyntropin exhibits the full corticosteroidogenic activity of natural ACTH. Various studies have shown that the biologic activity of ACTH resides in the N- terminal portion of the molecule and that the 1-20 amino acid residue is the minimal sequence retaining full activity. Partial or complete loss of activity is noted with progressive shortening of the chain beyond 20 amino acid residue. For example, the decrement from 20 to 19 results in a 70% loss of potency. The pharmacologic profile of Cosyntropin is similar to that of purified natural ACTH. It has been established that 0.25 mg of Cosyntropin will stimulate the adrenal cortex maximally and to the same extent as 25 units of natural ACTH. Cosyntropin has less immunogenic activity than ACTH because the amino acid sequence having most of the antigenic activity of ACTH, i.e., amino acids 25-39, is not present in cosyntropin. The extra-adrenal effects which natural ACTH and Cosyntropin have in common include increased melanotropic activity, increased growth hormone secretion and an adipokinetic effect. These are considered to be without physiological or clinical significance.	Cosyntropin combines with a specific receptor in the adrenal cell plasma membrane and, in patients with normal adrenocortical function, stimulates the initial reaction involved in the synthesis of adrenal steroids (including cortisol, cortisone, weak androgenic substances, and a limited quantity of aldosterone) from cholesterol by increasing the quantity of the substrate within the mitochondria.

It is an important player in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.	For use as a diagnostic agent in the screening of patients presumed to have adrenocortical insufficiency.	Corticotropin acts through the stimulation of cell surface ACTH receptors, which are primarily located on the adrenocortical cells. Corticotropin stimulates the cortex of the adrenal gland and boosts the synthesis of corticosteroids, mainly glucocorticoids but also sex steroids (androgens).

This results in a decreased hexamer formation and higher rate of absorption, compared to wild type insulin, following subcutaneous administration.	For the treatment of Type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus. Should normally be used in conjunction with an intermediate or long-acting insulin.	Insulin is a natural hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas. In non-diabetic individuals, a basal level of insulin is supplemented with insulin spikes following meals. Postprandial insulin spikes are responsible for the metabolic changes that occur as the body transitions from a postabsorptive to absorptive state. Insulin promotes cellular uptake of glucose, particularly in muscle and adipose tissues, promotes energy storage via glycogenesis, opposes catabolism of energy stores, increases DNA replication and protein synthesis by stimulating amino acid uptake by liver, muscle and adipose tissue, and modifies the activity of numerous enzymes involved in glycogen synthesis and glycolysis. Insulin also promotes growth and is required for the actions of growth hormone (e.g. protein synthesis, cell division, DNA synthesis). Insulin aspart is a rapid-acting insulin analogue used to mimic postprandial insulin spikes in diabetic individuals. The onset of action of insulin aspart is 10-15 minutes. Its activity peaks 60-90 minutes following subcutaneous injection and its duration of action is 4-5 hours.	Insulin aspart binds to the insulin receptor (IR), a heterotetrameric protein consisting of two extracellular alpha units and two transmembrane beta units. The binding of insulin to the alpha subunit of IR stimulates the tyrosine kinase activity intrinsic to the beta subunit of the receptor. The bound receptor autophosphorylates and phosphorylates numerous intracellular substrates such as insulin receptor substrates (IRS) proteins, Cbl, APS, Shc and Gab 1. Activation of these proteins leads to the activation of downstream signaling molecules including PI3 kinase and Akt. Akt regulates the activity of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and protein kinase C (PKC), both of which play critical roles in metabolism and catabolism. In humans, insulin is stored in the form of hexamers; however, only insulin monomers are able to interact with IR. Substitution of the proline residue at B28 with aspartic acid reduces the tendency to form hexamers and results in a faster rate of absorption and onset of action and shorter duration of action.	Inappropriately high dosages relative to food intake and/or energy expenditure may result in severe and sometimes prolonged and life-threatening hypoglycemia. Neurogenic (autonomic) signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia include trembling, palpitations, sweating, anxiety, hunger, nausea and tingling. Neuroglycopenic signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia include difficulty concentrating, lethargy/weakness, confusion, drowsiness, vision changes, difficulty speaking, headache, and dizziness. Mild hypoglycemia is characterized by the presence of autonomic symptoms. Moderate hypoglycemia is characterized by the presence of autonomic and neuroglycopenic symptoms.

This results in a decreased hexamer formation and higher rate of absorption, compared to wild type insulin, following subcutaneous administration.	For the treatment of Type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus. Should normally be used in conjunction with an intermediate or long-acting insulin.	Insulin is a natural hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas. In non-diabetic individuals, a basal level of insulin is supplemented with insulin spikes following meals. Postprandial insulin spikes are responsible for the metabolic changes that occur as the body transitions from a postabsorptive to absorptive state. Insulin promotes cellular uptake of glucose, particularly in muscle and adipose tissues, promotes energy storage via glycogenesis, opposes catabolism of energy stores, increases DNA replication and protein synthesis by stimulating amino acid uptake by liver, muscle and adipose tissue, and modifies the activity of numerous enzymes involved in glycogen synthesis and glycolysis. Insulin also promotes growth and is required for the actions of growth hormone (e.g. protein synthesis, cell division, DNA synthesis). Insulin aspart is a rapid-acting insulin analogue used to mimic postprandial insulin spikes in diabetic individuals. The onset of action of insulin aspart is 10-15 minutes. Its activity peaks 60-90 minutes following subcutaneous injection and its duration of action is 4-5 hours.	Insulin aspart binds to the insulin receptor (IR), a heterotetrameric protein consisting of two extracellular alpha units and two transmembrane beta units. The binding of insulin to the alpha subunit of IR stimulates the tyrosine kinase activity intrinsic to the beta subunit of the receptor. The bound receptor autophosphorylates and phosphorylates numerous intracellular substrates such as insulin receptor substrates (IRS) proteins, Cbl, APS, Shc and Gab 1. Activation of these proteins leads to the activation of downstream signaling molecules including PI3 kinase and Akt. Akt regulates the activity of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and protein kinase C (PKC), both of which play critical roles in metabolism and catabolism. In humans, insulin is stored in the form of hexamers; however, only insulin monomers are able to interact with IR. Substitution of the proline residue at B28 with aspartic acid reduces the tendency to form hexamers and results in a faster rate of absorption and onset of action and shorter duration of action.	Inappropriately high dosages relative to food intake and/or energy expenditure may result in severe and sometimes prolonged and life-threatening hypoglycemia. Neurogenic (autonomic) signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia include trembling, palpitations, sweating, anxiety, hunger, nausea and tingling. Neuroglycopenic signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia include difficulty concentrating, lethargy/weakness, confusion, drowsiness, vision changes, difficulty speaking, headache, and dizziness. Mild hypoglycemia is characterized by the presence of autonomic symptoms. Moderate hypoglycemia is characterized by the presence of autonomic and neuroglycopenic symptoms. Individuals may become unconscious in severe cases of hypoglycemia.	N.A.	Rapidly absorbed following subcutaneous administration (more so than regular human insulin). Furthermore, insulin aspart has a faster absorption, a faster onset of action, and a shorter duration of action than regular human insulin after subcutaneous injection.

Coupled with its slow systemic absorption from the injection site, prolongs its distribution into tissues enabling it to act for a longer time than native insulin.	For the treatment of type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus. May be used in combination with oral anti-diabetic agents in type 2 diabetic patients who are not in adequate metabolic control with oral anti-diabetic agents alone.	Insulin is a natural hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas. In non-diabetic individuals, a basal level of insulin is supplemented with insulin spikes following meals. Increased insulin secretion following meals is responsible for the metabolic changes that occur as the body transitions from a postabsorptive to absorptive state. Insulin promotes cellular uptake of glucose, particularly in muscle and adipose tissues, promotes energy storage via glycogenesis, opposes catabolism of energy stores, increases DNA replication and protein synthesis by stimulating amino acid uptake by liver, muscle and adipose tissue, and modifies the activity of numerous enzymes involved in glycogen synthesis and glycolysis. Insulin also promotes growth and is required for the actions of growth hormone (e.g. protein synthesis, cell division, DNA synthesis). Insulin detemir is a long-acting insulin analogue with a flat and predictable action profile. It is used to mimic the basal levels of insulin in diabetic individuals. The onset of action of insulin detemir is 1 to 2 hours and its duration of action is up to 24 hours. Interestingly, it has a lower affinity (30%) for the insulin receptor than human insulin.	Insulin detemir binds to the insulin receptor (IR), a heterotetrameric protein consisting of two extracellular alpha units and two transmembrane beta units. The binding of insulin to the alpha subunit of IR stimulates the tyrosine kinase activity intrinsic to the beta subunit of the receptor. The bound receptor autophosphorylates and phosphorylates numerous intracellular substrates such as insulin receptor substrates (IRS) proteins, Cbl, APS, Shc and Gab 1.

Akt regulates the activity of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and protein kinase C (PKC), both of which play critical roles in metabolism and catabolism.&#13; Insulin detemir's long duration of action appears to be a result of slow systemic absorption from the injection site and delayed distribution to target tissues. The myristic acid side chain on insulin detemir increases self-association and gives it a high binding affinity to serum albumin. These features slows its distribution into target tissues and prolongs its duration of action.	Hypoglycemia may occur with inappropriately high doses. Neurogenic (autonomic) signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia include trembling, palpitations, sweating, anxiety, hunger, nausea and tingling. Neuroglycopenic signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia include difficulty concentrating, lethargy/weakness, confusion, drowsiness, vision changes, difficulty speaking, headache, and dizziness. Mild hypoglycemia is characterized by the presence of autonomic symptoms. Moderate hypoglycemia is characterized by the presence of autonomic and neuroglycopenic symptoms. Individuals may become unconscious in severe cases of hypoglycemia. Injection site reactions may also occur. Symptoms include: redness, inflammation, bruising, swelling and itching at the injection site.	As with natural insulin, all metabolites formed are inactive.	Maximum serum concentrations are reached 6 to 8 hours following subcutaneous injection. When single dose of 0.5 units/kg of insulin detemir was given to adult type 1 diabetes patients, the maximum serum concentration (Cmax) was 4,641 Â± 2,299 pmol/L. Absorption is also dependent on the site of injection. When injected into the thigh, the AUC was lower than when injected into the deltoid and abdominal regions.

Insulin receptor	LEVEMIR	Novo Nordisk	LEVEMIR (insulin detemir [rDNA origin] injection) is a sterile solution of insulin detemir for use as a subcutaneous injection. Insulin detemir is a long-acting (up to 24-hour duration of action) recombinant human insulin analog. LEVEMIR is produced by a process that includes expression of recombinant DNA in Saccharomyces cerevisiae followed by chemical modification. Insulin detemir differs from human insulin in that the amino acid threonine in position B30 has been omitted, and a C14 fatty acid chain has been attached to the amino acid B29. Insulin detemir has a molecular formula of C267H402O76N64S6 and a molecular weight of 5916.9	LEVEMIR is indicated to improve glycemic control in adults and children with diabetes mellitus.	N.A.	Each milliliter of LEVEMIR contains 100 units (14.2 mg/mL) insulin detemir, 65.4 meg  inc, 2.06 mg m-cresol, 16.0 mg glycerol, 1.80 mg phenol, 0.89 mg disodium phosphate dihydrate, 1.17 mg sodium chloride, and water for injection. Hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide may be added to adjust pH. LEVEMIR has a pH of approximately 7.4	Clear, colorless, aqueous, neutral Sterile solution	Subcutaneous	Patients who require twice-daily dosing can administer the evening dose with the evening meal, at bedtime, or 12 hours after the morning dose. The dose of LEVEMIR must be individualized based on clinical response. Blood glucose monitoring is essential in all patients receiving insulin therapy.	LEVEMIR is not recommended for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis. Intravenous rapid-acting or short-acting insulin is the preferred treatment for this condition. LEVEMIR is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to LEVEMIR or any of its excipients. Reactions have included anaphylaxis.

LEVEMIR	For the treatment of type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus. May be used in combination with oral anti-diabetic agents in type 2 diabetic patients who are not in adequate metabolic control with oral anti-diabetic agents alone.	Insulin is a natural hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas. In non-diabetic individuals, a basal level of insulin is supplemented with insulin spikes following meals. Increased insulin secretion following meals is responsible for the metabolic changes that occur as the body transitions from a postabsorptive to absorptive state. Insulin promotes cellular uptake of glucose, particularly in muscle and adipose tissues, promotes energy storage via glycogenesis, opposes catabolism of energy stores, increases DNA replication and protein synthesis by stimulating amino acid uptake by liver, muscle and adipose tissue, and modifies the activity of numerous enzymes involved in glycogen synthesis and glycolysis. Insulin also promotes growth and is required for the actions of growth hormone (e.g. protein synthesis, cell division, DNA synthesis). Insulin detemir is a long-acting insulin analogue with a flat and predictable action profile. It is used to mimic the basal levels of insulin in diabetic individuals. The onset of action of insulin detemir is 1 to 2 hours and its duration of action is up to 24 hours. Interestingly, it has a lower affinity (30%) for the insulin receptor than human insulin.	Insulin detemir binds to the insulin receptor (IR), a heterotetrameric protein consisting of two extracellular alpha units and two transmembrane beta units. The binding of insulin to the alpha subunit of IR stimulates the tyrosine kinase activity intrinsic to the beta subunit of the receptor.

Insulin is a natural hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas. In non-diabetic individuals, a basal level of insulin is supplemented with insulin spikes following meals. Increased insulin secretion following meals is responsible for the metabolic changes that occur as the body transitions from a postabsorptive to absorptive state. Insulin promotes cellular uptake of glucose, particularly in muscle and adipose tissues, promotes energy storage via glycogenesis, opposes catabolism of energy stores, increases DNA replication and protein synthesis by stimulating amino acid uptake by liver, muscle and adipose tissue, and modifies the activity of numerous enzymes involved in glycogen synthesis and glycolysis. Insulin also promotes growth and is required for the actions of growth hormone (e.g. protein synthesis, cell division, DNA synthesis). Insulin detemir is a long-acting insulin analogue with a flat and predictable action profile. It is used to mimic the basal levels of insulin in diabetic individuals. The onset of action of insulin detemir is 1 to 2 hours and its duration of action is up to 24 hours. Interestingly, it has a lower affinity (30%) for the insulin receptor than human insulin.	Insulin detemir binds to the insulin receptor (IR), a heterotetrameric protein consisting of two extracellular alpha units and two transmembrane beta units. The binding of insulin to the alpha subunit of IR stimulates the tyrosine kinase activity intrinsic to the beta subunit of the receptor. The bound receptor autophosphorylates and phosphorylates numerous intracellular substrates such as insulin receptor substrates (IRS) proteins, Cbl, APS, Shc and Gab 1. Activation of these proteins leads to the activation of downstream signaling molecules including PI3 kinase and Akt. Akt regulates the activity of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and protein kinase C (PKC), both of which play critical roles in metabolism and catabolism.&#13; Insulin detemir's long duration of action appears to be a result of slow systemic absorption from the injection site and delayed distribution to target tissues. The myristic acid side chain on insulin detemir increases self-association and gives it a high binding affinity to serum albumin. These features slows its distribution into target tissues and prolongs its duration of action.	Hypoglycemia may occur with inappropriately high doses. Neurogenic (autonomic) signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia include trembling, palpitations, sweating, anxiety, hunger, nausea and tingling. Neuroglycopenic signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia include difficulty concentrating, lethargy/weakness, confusion, drowsiness, vision changes, difficulty speaking, headache, and dizziness.

Insulin receptor	APIDRA	sanofi-aventis	APIDRA (insulin glulisine [rDNA origin] injection) is a rapid-acting human insulin analog used to lower blood glucose. Insulin glulisine is produced by recombinant DNA technology utilizing a non-pathogenic laboratory strain of Escherichia coli (K12). Insulin glulisine differs from human insulin in that the amino acid asparagine at position B3 is replaced by lysine and the lysine in position B29 is replaced by glutamic acid. Chemically, insulin glulisine is 3B-lysine29B-glutamic acid-human insulin, has the empirical formula C258H384N64O78S6 and a molecular weight of 5823	APIDRA is indicated to improve glycemic control in adults and children with diabetes mellitus.	N.A.	Each milliliter of APIDRA contains 100 units (3.49 mg) insulin glulisine, 3.15 mg metacresol, 6 mg tromethamine, 5 mg sodium chloride, 0.01 mg polysorbate 20, and water for injection. APIDRA has a pH of approximately 7.3. The pH is adjusted by addition of aqueous solutions of hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide	Sterile, aqueous, clear, and colorless solution	N.A.	APIDRA is a recombinant insulin analog that is equipotent to human insulin (i.e. one unit of APIDRA has the same glucose-lowering effect as one unit of regular human insulin) when given intravenously. When given subcutaneously, APIDRA has a more rapid onset of action and a shorter duration of action than regular human insulin. The dosage of APIDRA must be individualized. Blood glucose monitoring is essential in all patients receiving insulin therapy. The total daily insulin requirement may vary and is usually between 0.5 to 1 Unit/kg/day. Insulin requirements may be altered during stress, major illness, or with changes in exercise, meal patterns, or coadministered drugs.	APIDRA is contraindicated: during episodes of hypoglycemia, in patients who are hypersensitive to APIDRA or to any of its excipients When used in patients with known hypersensitivity to APIDRA or its excipients, patients may develop localized or generalized hypersensitivity reactions.

May be used with oral antidiabetic agents.	Insulin is a natural hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas. In non-diabetic individuals, a basal level of insulin is supplemented with insulin spikes following meals. Postprandial insulin spikes are responsible for the metabolic changes that occur as the body transitions from a postabsorptive to absorptive state. Insulin promotes cellular uptake of glucose, particularly in muscle and adipose tissues, promotes energy storage via glycogenesis, opposes catabolism of energy stores, increases DNA replication and protein synthesis by stimulating amino acid uptake by liver, muscle and adipose tissue, and modifies the activity of numerous enzymes involved in glycogen synthesis and glycolysis. Insulin also promotes growth and is required for the actions of growth hormone (e.g. protein synthesis, cell division, DNA synthesis). Insulin glulisine is a rapid-acting insulin analogue used to mimic postprandial insulin spikes in diabetic individuals. The onset of action of insulin glulisine is approximately 15 minutes. Its activity peaks 60 minutes following subcutaneous injection and its duration of action is 2-4 hours.	Insulin glulisine binds to the insulin receptor (IR), a heterotetrameric protein consisting of two extracellular alpha units and two transmembrane beta units. The binding of insulin to the alpha subunit of IR stimulates the tyrosine kinase activity intrinsic to the beta subunit of the receptor. The bound receptor autophosphorylates and phosphorylates numerous intracellular substrates such as insulin receptor substrates (IRS) proteins, Cbl, APS, Shc and Gab 1. Activation of these proteins leads to the activation of downstream signaling molecules including PI3 kinase and Akt. Akt regulates the activity of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and protein kinase C (PKC), both of which play critical roles in metabolism and catabolism. In humans, insulin is stored in the form of hexamers; however, only insulin monomers are able to interact with IR. Substitution of the arginine at position B3 for lysine and replacement of the B29 lysine with glutamic acid decreases the propensity to form hexamers, stabilizes the hormone in monomeric form and results in a rapid rate of absorption and short duration of action.	Inappropriately high dosages relative to food intake and/or energy expenditure may result in severe and sometimes prolonged and life-threatening hypoglycemia. Neurogenic (autonomic) signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia include trembling, palpitations, sweating, anxiety, hunger, nausea and tingling. Neuroglycopenic signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia include difficulty concentrating, lethargy/weakness, confusion, drowsiness, vision changes, difficulty speaking, headache, and dizziness. Mild hypoglycemia is characterized by the presence of autonomic symptoms. Moderate hypoglycemia is characterized by the presence of autonomic and neuroglycopenic symptoms. Individuals may become unconscious in severe cases of hypoglycemia.	N.A.	Compared to regular human insulin, insulin glulisine is faster absorbed. When 0.15 units/kg was subcutaneously administered to type 1 diabetes patients, the pharmacokinetic parameters are as follows: Tmax = 60 minutes (range of 40 - 120 minutes); Cmax = 83 microUnits/mL (range of 40 - 131 microUnits/mL). Absolute bioavailability following subcutaneous administration is approximately 70%, regardless of site of injection.	13 L	N.A.	Antidiabetic Agents	N.A.	N.A.	N.A.	N.A.	N.A.	N.A.	N.A.	N.A.	N.A.	N.A.

[Wikipedia]	For the treatment of neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration.	Pegaptanib is a selective vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antagonist. VEGF is a secreted protein that selectively binds and activates its receptors located primarily on the surface of vascular endothelial cells. VEGF induces angiogenesis, and increases vascular permeability and inflammation, all of which are thought to contribute to the progression of the neovascular (wet) form of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a leading cause of blindness. VEGF has been implicated in blood retinal barrier breakdown and pathological ocular neovascularization.	Pegaptanib binds to the major pathological VEGF isoform, extracellular VEGF165, thereby inhibiting VEGF165 binding to its VEGF receptors. The inhibition of VEGF164, the rodent counterpart of human VEGF165, was effective at suppressing pathological neovascularization.	Most common adverse reactions associated with the use of lucinactant are endotracheal tube reflux, pallor, endotracheal tube obstruction, and need for dose interruption.	Based on preclinical data, pegaptanib is metabolized by endo- and exonucleases.	In animals, pegaptanib is slowly absorbed into the systemic circulation from the eye after intravitreous administration.	N.A.	N.A.

Approx. 18 mins	Recombinant, 32 amino acid human B-type natriuretic peptide, which is normally produced by the ventricular myocardium. Nesiritide is a medication used to treat acutely decompensated congestive heart failure with dyspnea at rest or with minimal exertion.	For the intravenous treatment of patients with acutely decompensated congestive heart failure who have dyspnea at rest or with minimal activity.	Nesiritide works to facilitate cardiovascular fluid homeostasis through counterregulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldoesterone system, stimulating cyclic guanosine monophosphate, leading to smooth muscle cell relaxation. In simpler terms, it promotes vasodilation, natriuresis, and diuresis.	Human BNP binds to the particulate guanylate cyclase receptor of vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells, leading to increased intracellular concentrations of guanosine 3'5'-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) and smooth muscle cell relaxation. Cyclic GMP serves as a second messenger to dilate veins and arteries. Nesiritide has been shown to relax isolated human arterial and venous tissue preparations that were precontracted with either endothelin-1 or the alpha-adrenergic agonist, phenylephrine. In human studies, nesiritide produced dose-dependent reductions in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) and systemic arterial pressure in patients with heart failure. In animals, nesiritide had no effects on cardiac contractility or on measures of cardiac electrophysiology such as atrial and ventricular effective refractory times or atrioventricular node conduction. Naturally occurring atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), a related peptide, increases vascular permeability in animals and humans and may reduce intravascular volume. The effect of nesiritide on vascular permeability has not been studied.&#13;	No data are available with respect to overdosage in humans.  The expected reaction would be excessive hypotension, which should be treated with drug discontinuation or reduction and appropriate measures.	Nesiritide undergoes proteolytic cleavage of the peptide by endopeptidases, such as neutral endopeptidase, which are present on the vascular lumenal surface.

Thymalfasin is a 28-amino acid polypeptide produced synthetically but originally isolated from thymosin fraction 5, a bovine thymus extract containing a number of immunologically active peptides. In vitro studies have shown that Thymalfasin can influence T-cell production and maturation, stimulate production of Th1 cytokines such as interferon-gamma and interleukin-2, and activate natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity.	The mechanism of action of thymalfasin is not completely understood but is thought to be related to its immunomodulating activities, centered primarily around augmentation of T-cell function. In various in vitro assays, thymosin alpha 1 has been shown to promote T-cell differentiation and maturation; for example, CD4+, CD8+, and CD3+ cells have all been shown to be increased. Thymosin alpha 1 has also been shown to increase production of IFN-g, IL-2, IL-3, and expression of IL-2 receptor following activation by mitogens or antigens, increase NK cell activity, increase production of migratory inhibitory factor (MIF), and increase antibody response to T-cell dependent antigens. Thymosin alpha 1 has also been shown to antagonize dexamethasone-induced apoptosis of thymocytes in vitro. In vivo administration of thymosin alpha 1 to animals immunosuppressed by chemotherapy, tumor burden, or irradiation showed that thymosin alpha 1 protects against cytotoxic damage to bone marrow, tumor progression and opportunistic infections, thereby increasing survival time and number of survivors. Many of the in vitro and in vivo effects of thymosin alpha 1 have been interpreted as influences on either differentiation of pluripotent stem cells to thymocytes or activation of thymocytes into activated T-cells. Thymalfasin also has been shown in vitro to upregulate expression of toll like receptors (TLR) including TLR2 and TLR9 in mouse and human dendritic cells, as well as activate NF-kB and JNK/P38/AP1 pathways. Thymalfasin's activation of dendritic cells provides another possible pathway explaining thymalfasin's immunomodulatory and antiviral effects.	There are no reported instances of deliberate or accidental overdosage in humans. Animal toxicology studies have shown no adverse reactions in single doses up to 20 mg/kg and in repeated doses up to 6 mg/kg/day for 13 weeks, which were the highest doses studied. The highest single dose tested in animals represents 800-times the clinical dose.	N.A.	Rapidly absorbed with peak serum levels achieved at approximately 2 hours.	N.A.	N.A.	N.A.	N.A.	N.A.	N.A.	N.A.

Glatiramer acetate comprises acetate salts of synthetic polypeptides, containing four naturally occurring amino acids: L-glutamic acid, L-alanine, L-tyrosine, and L-lysine with an average molar fraction of 0.141, 0.427, 0.095, and 0.338, respectively. The average molecular weight of glatiramer acetate is 5,000-9,000 daltons.  It is an immunomodulator, known to reduce the frequency of relapses in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis	For reduction of the frequency of relapses in patients with Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis.	Glatiramer acetate was originally designed to mimic a protein in myelin, called myelin basic protein, with the intention of inducing EAE (an animal model of MS). Quite to the contrary, it was found to suppress the disease and as a result came to be trialed in human MS. There is some evidence that Glatiramer acetate converts the body's immune response from a Th1 type to a Th2 one, promotes suppressor T cells or acts as an altered peptide ligand. Studies in animals and in vitro systems suggest that upon its administration, glatiramer acetate-specific suppressor T-cells are induced and activated in the periphery. Some fraction of the injected material, either intact or partially hydrolyzed, is presumed to enter the lymphatic circulation, enabling it to reach regional lymph nodes, and some may enter the systemic circulation intact.	Glatiramer acetate (GA) exhibits strong and promiscuous binding to MHC molecules (HLA DRB1* variants) and consequent competition with various myelin antigens for their presentation to T cells. A further aspect of its action is potent induction of specific suppressor cells of the T helper 2 (Th2) type that migrate to the brain and lead to in situ bystander suppression. Furthermore, the GA-specific cells in the brain express the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and transforming growth factor beta, in addition to brain-derived neurotrophic factor, whereas they do not express the inflammatory cytokine IFN-gamma. Recent evidence also suggests that Glatiramer acetate directly inhibits dendritic cells and monocytes - both of which are circulating antigen presenting cells.

Preos is a registered trade mark owned by NPS Pharmaceuticals, Inc. The name Preos and the New Drug Application is pending approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).	For use/treatment in osteoporosis.	Parathyroid hormone is responsible for the fine regulation of serum calcium concentration on a minute-to-minute basis. This is achieved by the acute effects of the hormone on calcium resorption in bone and calcium reabsorption in the kidney. The phosphate mobilized from bone is excreted into the urine by means of the hormone's influence on renal phosphate handling. Parathyroid hormone also stimulates calcium absorption in the intestine, this being mediated indirectly by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. Thus, a hypocalcemic stimulus of parathyroid hormone secretion results in an increased influx of calcium from three sources (bone, kidney, and intestine), resulting in a normalization of the serum calcium concentration without change in the serum phosphate concentration.	The biological actions of rhPTH are mediated through binding to at least two distinct high- affinity cell-surface receptors specific for the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of the molecule, both of which are required for normal bone metabolism. The N-terminal portion of the molecule is primarily responsible for the bone building effects of parathyroid hormone. The C-terminal portion of the molecule has antiresorptive activity and is necessary for normal regulation of N-terminal fragment activity.	N.A.	PTH is metabolised in the liver and to a lesser extent in the kidney. Parathyroid hormone is efficiently removed from the blood by a receptor-mediated process in the liver and is broken down into smaller peptide fragments. The fragments derived from the amino-terminus are further degraded within the cell while the fragments derived from the carboxy-terminus are released back into the blood and cleared by the kidney. These carboxy-terminal fragments are thought to play a role in the regulation of PTH activity. Under normal physiological conditions full-length PTH constitutes only 5-30% of the circulating forms of the molecule, while 70-95% is present as carboxy-terminal fragments. Following administration of Preotact, carboxy-terminal fragments make up about 60-90% of the circulating forms of the molecule. Intersubject variability in systemic clearance is about 15%.	The absolute bioavailability of 100 micrograms of Preotact after subcutaneous administration in the abdomen is 55%.	The volume of distribution at steady-state following intravenous administration is approximately 5.4 liters. Intersubject variability is about 40%.

It is a mixture of several compounds majorly teicoplanin A2-1 through A2-5, along with four minor ones, teicoplanin RS-1 through RS-4. They all share a same glycopeptide core, referred to as teicoplanin A3-1, which is a fused ring structure bound by two carbohydrates (mannose and N-acetylglucosamine). The components also contain a third carbohydrate moiety, β-D-glucosamine, and differ only by the length and conformation of a side chain attached to it. 	For the treatment of bacterial infections caused by susceptible microorganisms.	Teicoplanin is an antibiotic used in the prophylaxis and treatment of serious infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. It is a glycopeptide antiobiotic extracted from Actinoplanes teichomyceticus, with a similar spectrum of activity to vancomycin. Its mechanism of action is to inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis. Oral teicoplanin has been demonstrated to be effective in the treatment of pseudomembranous colitis and Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea, with comparable efficacy to vancomycin.	Teicoplanin inhibits peptidoglycan polymerization, resulting in inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis and cell death.	N.A.	Two metabolites (metabolites 1 and 2; 2 to 3% of total teicoplanin) have been isolated after intravenous administration of radiolabeled teicoplanin. After purification, their structures were found to be new teicoplanin-like molecules, bearing 8-hydroxydecanoic and 9-hydroxydecanoic acyl moieties. This metabolic transformation is likely due to hydroxylation in the omega-2 and omega-1 positions for metabolites 1 and 2, respectively, of the C-10 linear side chain of component A2-3. This might explain the low extent of metabolism of teicoplanin if we consider that only component A2-3 has a linear chain that is susceptible to such oxidation.

It is expressed in a murine Sp2/0-Ag14 cell line and comprised of two 447-(or 448-) residue heavy chains and two 214-residue light chains, with a molecular mass of 145157 Daltons when deglycosylated. Both heavy chains of canakinumab contain oligosaccharide chains linked to the protein backbone at asparagine 298 (Asn 298). The biological activity of canakinumab is measured by comparing its inhibition of IL-1β-dependent expression of the reporter gene luciferase to that of a canakinumab internal reference standard, using a stably transfected cell line.

Reconstitution with 1 mL of preservative-free Sterile Water for Injection is required prior to subcutaneous administration of the drug. The reconstituted canakinumab is a 150 mg/mL solution essentially free of particulates, clear to slightly opalescent, and is colorless or may have a slightly brownish-yellow tint. A volume of up to 1 mL can be withdrawn for delivery of 150 mg/mL canakinumab for subcutaneous administration. Each reconstituted vial contains 180 mg canakinumab, sucrose, L-histidine, L-histidine HCL monohydrate, polysorbate 80 and Sterile Water for Injection. No preservatives are present.	180 mg of canakinumab as a white, preservative-free, lyophilized powder	Subcutaneous	Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS): The recommended dose of ILARIS is 150 mg for CAPS patients with body weight greater than 40 kg.

N.A.	N.A.	Terminal Elimination Half-life: 14.7 -15.4 days 	Recombinant, human monoclonal IgG1 kappa immunoglobin. It is an antineoplastic agent developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb and Medarex for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma in adults. Ipilimumab received FDA approval on March 25, 2011.	Ipilimumab is indicated for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma in adults.	The pharmacodynamics of Ipilimumab are not completely understood. In melanoma patients receiving Ipilimumab, the mean peripheral blood absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC) increased throughout the induction dosing period. This increase occurred in a dose-dependent fashion in Phase 2 studies. Ipilimumab given with or without gp100 at 3 mg/kg increased ALC throughout the induction dosing period, but no meaningful change in ALC occurred in the control group who received an investigational peptide vaccine alone. Furthermore, ipilimumab binds to CTLA-4 with high affinity (Kd = 5.24 ± 3.62 nM). As a result, ligands CD80 and CD86 are blocked from binding to CTLA-4 with a minimum EC50 value of 0.2 μg/mL.	Ipilimumab is a fully human IgG1K antibody that binds to CTLA-4 (cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4), a molecule on T-cells that is indicated for unresectable or metastatic melanoma. The absence or presence of CTLA-4 can augment or suppress the immune system's T-cell response in fighting disease. Ipilimumab is designed to block the activity of CTLA-4, thereby sustaining an active immune response in its attack on cancer cells. The proposed mechanism of action is indirect, and may be through T-cell - mediated anti-tumor immune responses. 	Therapy with Ipilimumab can result in severe and fatal immune reactions due to T-cell proliferation and activation. These reactions may occur in multiple organ systems, but common reactions include enterecolitis, dermatitis (including toxic necrolysis), neuropathy, and endocrinopathy. Patients should be assessed for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis (diarrhea, abdominal pain, mucus/blood in stool), bowel perforation (petitoneal signs and ileus), hepatitis, dermatitis (rash and pruritus), motor or sensory neuropathy (unilateral/bilateral weakness, sensory alterations, or paresthesia) , hypophysitis/adrenal insufficiency including adrenal crisis/hyper- or hypothyroidism (fatigue, mental status change, abdominal pain, unusual bowel habits, hypotension) and should have liver function tests and thyroid function tests performed at baseline and prior to each dose. Typically immune mediated adverse reactions manifest during therapy, however, a minority of reactions occurred after discontinuation of ipilimumab. In one study of neuropathies, one case of fatal Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome occurred, and once case of severe peripheral neuropathy (Grade 3) was reported. During clinical development of ipilimumab additional cases of Guillain-BarrÃ© and myasthenia gravis have been reported. In severe neuropathy, permanently discontinue ipilimumab, and initiate 1-2mg/kd/day of prednisone or equivalent. In one study, severe or potentially fatal dermatitis (eg, Steven-Johnsons syndrome (SJS) or toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)) occured in 2.5% (n=13). The median time of onset of moderate to potentially fatal dermatitis was 3.1 weeks (up to 17.3 weeks). Treatment of 54% of severe dermatitis cases (n=7) involved high dose topical corticosteriods. 6 patients had complete resolution in up to 15.6 weeks. Permanently discontinue ipilimumab in patients with SJS or TEN, and withhold the dose in patients with moderate to severe signs and symptoms. Mild- moderate dermatitis (localized rash and pruritus) may be treated symptomatically. If no improvement is seen in 1 week administer topical or systemic corticosteroids. In one study of endocrinopathies, severe to life threatening endocrinopathies occurred in 1.8% (n=9) of patients, with all 9 patients having hyopituitarism and some having adrenal insufficiency, hypogonadism, and hypothyroidism. Six of the 9 patients were hospitalized. Moderate endocrinopathies occurred in 2.3% of patients (n=12) and required hormone replacement or medical intervention. The median time of onset was 11 weeks. In symptomatic patients, withhold ipilimumab, and initiate 1-2mg/kd/day of prednisone or equivalent and appropriate hormone replacement therapy.   In one study of enterocolitis in 511 patients, diarrhea of ≥ 7 stools above baseline, fever, ileus and peritoneal signs (Grade 3-5, severe, potentially fatal enterocolitis) occured in 7% (n=34) of patients treated with ipilimumab. Diarrhea of up to 6 stools above baseline, abdominal pain, mucus or blood in stool (Grade 2, moderate enterocolitis) occurred in 5% of patients (n=28). Intestinal perforation occurred in 1% (n=5). Death as a result of complications occurred in 0.8% (n=4). Hospitalization for severe enterocolitis occurred in 5% (n=26).  Grade 3-5 enterocolitis had a median time of onset of 7.4 weeks (with a range of 1.6-13.4 weeks). Grade 2 entercolitis had a median time of onset of 6.3 weeks (with a range of 0.3- 18.9 weeks). Treatment of 85% (n=29) of patients with Grade 3-5 enterocolitis (n=34) included high dose corticosteroids (≥ 40mg/day prednisone equivalent). Median dose used was 80mg/day of prednisone/equivalent for a median duration of 2.3 weeks (up to 13.9 weeks). Of the 34 patients, 74% experienced complete resolution, 3% progressed to Grade 2 severity, and 24% exhibited no improvement. &#13; In treatment of 28 patients with a Grade 2 enterocolitis: 25% received high dose corticosteroids for a median of 10 days; 29% of patients received a non-high dose of corticosteroids (≥ 40mg/day of prednisone/equivalent) for a median duration of 5.1 weeks; 46% did not receive systemic corticosteroids. Of the 28 patients, 79% of patients experienced complete resolution, 11% improved in severity, 11% exhibited no improvement. In patients with severe enterocolitis, permanently discontinue ipilimumab, and initiate 1-2 mg/kd/day of prednisone or an equivalent. Once patient improvement to Grade 1 or less is seen, taper the corticosteroid over at least one month. In patients with moderate enterocolitis, hold dose of ipilimumab, and initiate 0.5 mg/kd/day of prednisone or an equivalent. In another study examining immune mediated hepatitis, AST or ALT elevation of ≥ 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) (severe and potentially fatal hepatotoxicity) was seen in 2% (n=8) of patients on ipilimumab. Fatal hepatic failure occurred in 0.2%. Hospitalization occurred in 0.4%. Additionally, moderate hepatotoxicity (2.5xULN >ALT or AST> 5xULN, or 1.5xULN>bilirubin>3xULN ) occurred in 2.5% (n=13). In Grade 3-5 hepatotoxicity, permanently discontinue ipilimumab, and initiate 1-2mg/kd/day of prednisone or equivalent. Once LFT show sustained improvement taper corticosteroid over 1 month. In Grade 2 hepatotoxicity, withhold ipilimumab. In pregnancy, use only if potential benefit justifies potential risk to fetus (Category C). In studies done in monkeys, severe toxicities were observed including abortion, stillbirth, low birth weight and infant mortality. Additionally, ipilimumab has the potential to cross the placental barrier, and it is unknown if secretion into breast milk occurs. No studies have been performed to study carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, and impairment of fertility.	The metabolism of ipilimumab does not involve the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. Because ipilimumab is a protein it is expected to be degraded into small peptides and amino acids by proteolytic enzymes.	In one pharmacokinetic study of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma peak concentrations, trough concentrations, and area under the curve (AUC) were found to be dose proportional in the dosage range examined (0.3, 3, or 10mg/kg every 3 weeks for four doses).	Volume of distribution at steady state = 7.21 L	Clearance was measured to be 15.3mL/hr-16.8 mL/hr.In one pharmacokinetic study examining ipilimumab administered every 3 weeks, clearance was found to be time invariant. Minimal systemic accumulation was observed (accumulation index of 1.5 fold or less).Steady state concentrations was reached by the third dose.Clearance will increase with increasing body weight; however, no dose adjustment is needed if administration occurs on a mg/kg basis. The following had no clinically meaningful influence on clearance: Age (range 26-86 years), gender, creatinine clearance (if â‰¥29ml/min), baseline AST, total bilirubin, ALT levels, concomitant use of budesonide, performance status, HLA-A2*0201 status, positive anti-ipilimumab antibody status, prior use of systemic anticancer therapy, baseline lactate dehydrogenase levels.

The low molecular weight of both sulodexide fractions allows for extensive oral absorption compared to unfractionated heparin. The pharmacological effects of sulodexide differ substantially from other glycosaminoglycans and are mainly characterized by a prolonged half-life and reduced effect on global coagulation and bleeding parameters. Due to the presence of both glycosaminoglycan fractions, sulodexide potentiates the antiprotease activities of both antithrombin III and heparin cofactor II simultaneously.

The light chain is made up of 214 amino acids and the heavy chain is made up of 448 amino acids.	Indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who have had an inadequate response to one or more Disease-Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs (DMARDs). It is also indicated for the treatment of active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (PJIA) and active systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA) in patients 2 years of age and older.	A decrease in C-reactive protein (CRP) was noted as early as week 2. Changes in pharmacodynamic parameters were observed (i.e., decreases in rheumatoid factor, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), serum amyloid A and increases in hemoglobin) with both doses, however the greatest improvements were observed with 8 mg per kg tocilizumab. Similar pharmacodynamic changes were also observed in active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and active systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis patients.	Interleukin (IL)-6 plays essential roles not only in the immune response, but also in haematopoiesis and the central nervous system. Deregulated production of IL-6 has been found in chronic inflammatory autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis (soJIA), Crohn's disease (CD) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Furthermore, IL-6 activities can explain many symptoms of these diseases. More importantly, serum levels of IL-6 are correlated with disease activity. Tocilizumab binds specifically to both soluble and membrane-bound IL-6 receptors (sIL-6R and mIL-6R), and has been shown to inhibit IL-6-mediated signaling through these receptors.	Most common adverse reactions (incidence of at least 5%): upper respiratory tract infections, nasopharyngitis, headache, hypertension, increased ALT.	N.A.	When 4 mg/kg of tocilizumab was given every 4 weeks to RA patients, the pharmacokinetic parameters at steady state are as follows: AUC = 13000 ± 5800 mcg h/mL; Cmax = 88.3 ± 41.4 mcg/mL. Tocilizumab accumulates following repeated doses. Furthermore, an increased body weight may increase plasma levels of tocilizumab. When a dose of 8 mg/kg of tocilizumab is given to PJIA patients, the pharmacokinetic parameters are as follows: AUC =  29500 ± 8660 mcg h/mL; Cmax = 182 ± 37 mcg/mL. When a dose of 8 mg/kg of tocilizumab is given to SJIA patients, the pharmacokinetic parameters are as follows: AUC = 32200 ± 9960 mcg h/m; Cmax = 245 ± 57.2 mcg/mL.	In rheumatoid arthritis patients the central volume of distribution was 3.5 L and the peripheral volume of distribution was 2.9 L, resulting in a volume of distribution at steady state of 6.4 L.In pediatric patients with PJIA, the central volume of distribution was 1.98 L, the peripheral volume of distribution was 2.1 L, resulting in a volume of distribution at steady state of 4.08 L.In pediatric patients with SJIA, the central volume of distribution was 0.94 L, the peripheral volume of distribution was 1.60 L resulting in a volume of distribution at steady state of 2.54 L.	The clearance of tocilizumab decreases with increasing dose. At the 10 mg/kg single dose in RA patients, mean clearance was 0.29 Â± 0.10 mL/hr/kg. The total clearance of tocilizumab is concentration-dependent and is the sum of the linear clearance and the nonlinear clearance. At low concentrations, concentration-dependent nonlinear clearance is dominant. At high concentrations, linear clearance dominates. The estimated linear clearances for specific patient populations are as follows:RA = 12.5 mL/h;PJIA, pediatric patients = 5.8 mL/h;SJIA, pediatric patients = 7.1 mL/h.	N.A.

The light chain is made up of 214 amino acids and the heavy chain is made up of 448 amino acids.	Indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who have had an inadequate response to one or more Disease-Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs (DMARDs). It is also indicated for the treatment of active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (PJIA) and active systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA) in patients 2 years of age and older.	A decrease in C-reactive protein (CRP) was noted as early as week 2. Changes in pharmacodynamic parameters were observed (i.e., decreases in rheumatoid factor, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), serum amyloid A and increases in hemoglobin) with both doses, however the greatest improvements were observed with 8 mg per kg tocilizumab. Similar pharmacodynamic changes were also observed in active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and active systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis patients.	Interleukin (IL)-6 plays essential roles not only in the immune response, but also in haematopoiesis and the central nervous system. Deregulated production of IL-6 has been found in chronic inflammatory autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis (soJIA), Crohn's disease (CD) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Furthermore, IL-6 activities can explain many symptoms of these diseases. More importantly, serum levels of IL-6 are correlated with disease activity. Tocilizumab binds specifically to both soluble and membrane-bound IL-6 receptors (sIL-6R and mIL-6R), and has been shown to inhibit IL-6-mediated signaling through these receptors.	Most common adverse reactions (incidence of at least 5%): upper respiratory tract infections, nasopharyngitis, headache, hypertension, increased ALT.	N.A.	When 4 mg/kg of tocilizumab was given every 4 weeks to RA patients, the pharmacokinetic parameters at steady state are as follows: AUC = 13000 ± 5800 mcg h/mL; Cmax = 88.3 ± 41.4 mcg/mL. Tocilizumab accumulates following repeated doses. Furthermore, an increased body weight may increase plasma levels of tocilizumab. When a dose of 8 mg/kg of tocilizumab is given to PJIA patients, the pharmacokinetic parameters are as follows: AUC =  29500 ± 8660 mcg h/mL; Cmax = 182 ± 37 mcg/mL. When a dose of 8 mg/kg of tocilizumab is given to SJIA patients, the pharmacokinetic parameters are as follows: AUC = 32200 ± 9960 mcg h/m; Cmax = 245 ± 57.2 mcg/mL.	In rheumatoid arthritis patients the central volume of distribution was 3.5 L and the peripheral volume of distribution was 2.9 L, resulting in a volume of distribution at steady state of 6.4 L.In pediatric patients with PJIA, the central volume of distribution was 1.98 L, the peripheral volume of distribution was 2.1 L, resulting in a volume of distribution at steady state of 4.08 L.In pediatric patients with SJIA, the central volume of distribution was 0.94 L, the peripheral volume of distribution was 1.60 L resulting in a volume of distribution at steady state of 2.54 L.	The clearance of tocilizumab decreases with increasing dose. At the 10 mg/kg single dose in RA patients, mean clearance was 0.29 Â± 0.10 mL/hr/kg. The total clearance of tocilizumab is concentration-dependent and is the sum of the linear clearance and the nonlinear clearance. At low concentrations, concentration-dependent nonlinear clearance is dominant. At high concentrations, linear clearance dominates. The estimated linear clearances for specific patient populations are as follows:RA = 12.5 mL/h;PJIA, pediatric patients = 5.8 mL/h;SJIA, pediatric patients = 7.1 mL/h.	N.A.

Rilonacept is currently used in the treatment of cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome. In May 2012, an advisory panel for the FDA voted 11-0 against the use of Rilonacept for the treatment of gout.	Treatment with Rilonacept resulted in decreased levels of mean C-Reactive Protein (CRP) and Serum Amyloid A (SAA). Higher levels of CRP and SAA are associated with inflammatory disease activity found in patients with Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes.	CAPS refer to rare genetic syndromes generally caused by mutations in the NLRP-3 [Nucleotide-binding domain, leucine rich family (NLR), pyrin domain containing 3] gene (also known as Cold-Induced Auto-inflammatory Syndtrome-1 [CIAS1]). CAPS disorders are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern with male and female offspring equally affected. Fever, urticaria-like rash, arthralgia, myalgia, fatigue, and conjunctivitis are features common to all disorders. In most cases, inflammation in CAPS is associated with mutations in the NLRP-3 gene which encodes the protein cryopyrin, an important component of the inflammasome. Cryopyrin regulates the protease caspase-1 and controls the activation of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β). Mutations in NLRP-3 result in an overactive inflammasome resulting in excessive release of activated IL-1β that drives inflammation. Rilonacept blocks IL-1β signaling by acting as a soluble decoy receptor that binds IL-1β and prevents its interaction with cell surface receptors. Rilonacept also binds IL-1Î± and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) with reduced affinity. By binding IL-1, rilonacept prevents the activation of IL-1 receptors, thus reducing inflammatory responses and other effects related to an excess of IL-1.	N.A.	N.A.	N.A.	N.A.	N.A.

Treatment with Rilonacept resulted in decreased levels of mean C-Reactive Protein (CRP) and Serum Amyloid A (SAA). Higher levels of CRP and SAA are associated with inflammatory disease activity found in patients with Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes.	CAPS refer to rare genetic syndromes generally caused by mutations in the NLRP-3 [Nucleotide-binding domain, leucine rich family (NLR), pyrin domain containing 3] gene (also known as Cold-Induced Auto-inflammatory Syndtrome-1 [CIAS1]). CAPS disorders are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern with male and female offspring equally affected. Fever, urticaria-like rash, arthralgia, myalgia, fatigue, and conjunctivitis are features common to all disorders. In most cases, inflammation in CAPS is associated with mutations in the NLRP-3 gene which encodes the protein cryopyrin, an important component of the inflammasome. Cryopyrin regulates the protease caspase-1 and controls the activation of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β). Mutations in NLRP-3 result in an overactive inflammasome resulting in excessive release of activated IL-1β that drives inflammation.

Each light chain consists of 215 amino acids and the heavy chain consists of 448 amino acids. FDA approved on June 1, 2010.	Prolia is indicated for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture. It reduces the incidence of vertebral, nonvertebral, and hip fractures. Prolia is also indicated as a treatment to increase bone mass in women at high risk for fracture receiving adjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy for breast cancer. It can also be used in men with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture or in men receiving androgen deprivation therapy for nonmetastatic prostate cancer to increase bone mass. Xgeva is indicated for the prevention of skeletal-related events in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors.	In clinical studies, treatment with 60 mg of Prolia resulted in reduction in the bone resorption marker serum type 1 C-telopeptide (CTX) by approximately 85% by 3 days. Consistent with the physiological coupling of bone formation and resorption in skeletal remodeling, subsequent reductions in bone formation markers (i.e. osteocalcin and procollagen type 1 N-terminal peptide [PlNP]) were observed starting 1 month after the first dose of Prolia.	Denosumab is designed to target RANKL (RANK ligand), a protein that acts as the primary signal to promote bone removal/resorption. In many bone loss conditions, RANKL overwhelms the body's natural defense against bone destruction. Denosumab prevents RANKL from activating its receptor, RANK, on the surface of osteoclasts and their precursors. Prevention of the RANKL/RANK interaction inhibits osteoclast formation, function, and survival, thereby decreasing bone resorption and increasing bone mass and strength in both cortical and trabecular bone.

Consistent with the physiological coupling of bone formation and resorption in skeletal remodeling, subsequent reductions in bone formation markers (i.e. osteocalcin and procollagen type 1 N-terminal peptide [PlNP]) were observed starting 1 month after the first dose of Prolia.	Denosumab is designed to target RANKL (RANK ligand), a protein that acts as the primary signal to promote bone removal/resorption. In many bone loss conditions, RANKL overwhelms the body's natural defense against bone destruction. Denosumab prevents RANKL from activating its receptor, RANK, on the surface of osteoclasts and their precursors. Prevention of the RANKL/RANK interaction inhibits osteoclast formation, function, and survival, thereby decreasing bone resorption and increasing bone mass and strength in both cortical and trabecular bone.	In patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis, the most common adverse reactions (> 5% and more common than placebo) were: back pain, pain in extremity, hypercholesterolemia, musculoskeletal pain, and cystitis.  Pancreatitis has been reported in clinical trials. In male patients with osteoporosis, the most common adverse reactions (> 5% and more common than placebo) were: back pain, arthralgia, and nasopharyngitis. In patients experiencing bone loss due to hormone ablation for cancer, the most common adverse reactions (≥ 10% and more common than placebo) were: arthralgia and back pain.  Pain in extremity and musculoskeletal pain have also been reported in clinical trials	N.A.	When 60 mg of denosumab was subcutaneously administered to healthy subjects after fasting for 12 hours, the pharmacokinetic parameters are as follows: Cmax = 6.75 mcg/mL; Tmax= 10 days (range of 3 to 21 days); AUC (0-16 weeks) = 316 mcg day/mL. Denosumab does not accumulate following multiple doses once every 6 months. The pharmacokinetics of denosumab were not affected by the formation of antibodies.	N.A.	N.A.

Prolia is indicated for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture. It reduces the incidence of vertebral, nonvertebral, and hip fractures. Prolia is also indicated as a treatment to increase bone mass in women at high risk for fracture receiving adjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy for breast cancer.

The recombinant peptide precursor of liraglutide, produced by its expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, has been engineered to be 97% homologous to native human GLP-1 by substituting R for K at position 34. Liraglutide was designed by attaching a C-16 fatty acid (palmitic acid) with a glutamic acid spacer on the remaining lysine residue at position 26 of the peptide precursor.	For use in/treatment of diabetes mellitus type 2.	Liraglutide is a once-daily GLP-1 derivative for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. GLP-1, in its natural form, is short-lived in the body (the half-life after subcutaneous injection is approximately one hour), so it is not very useful as a therapeutic agent. However, liraglutide has a half-life after subcutaneous injection of 11â€“15 hours, making it suitable for once-daily dosing. The prolonged action of liraglutide is achieved by attaching a fatty acid molecule at one position of the GLP-1 molecule, enabling it to bind to albumin within the subcutaneous tissue and bloodstream. The active GLP-1 is then released from albumin at a slow, consistent rate. Binding with albumin also results in slower degradation and reduced elimination of liraglutide from the circulation by the kidneys compared to GLP-1.	Liraglutide is an acylated GLP-1 (Glucagon-Like Peptide-1) receptor agonist. Liraglutide upregulates intracellular cAMP resulting in the release of insulin given elevated blood glucose concentrations. Glucagon secretion is also decreased in a glucose-dependent fashion by liraglutide.	In a clinical trial, one patient with type 2 diabetes experienced a single overdose of Victoza 17.4 mg subcutaneous (10 times the maximum recommended dose). Effects of the overdose included severe nausea and vomiting requiring hospitalization. No hypoglycemia was reported. The patient recovered without complications. In the event of overdosage, appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated according to the patient's clinical signs and symptoms. RISK OF THYROID C-CELL TUMORS	During the initial 24 hours following administration of a single [3H]-liraglutide dose to healthy subjects, the major component in plasma was intact liraglutide.

The prolonged action of liraglutide is achieved by attaching a fatty acid molecule at one position of the GLP-1 molecule, enabling it to bind to albumin within the subcutaneous tissue and bloodstream. The active GLP-1 is then released from albumin at a slow, consistent rate. Binding with albumin also results in slower degradation and reduced elimination of liraglutide from the circulation by the kidneys compared to GLP-1.	Liraglutide is an acylated GLP-1 (Glucagon-Like Peptide-1) receptor agonist. Liraglutide upregulates intracellular cAMP resulting in the release of insulin given elevated blood glucose concentrations. Glucagon secretion is also decreased in a glucose-dependent fashion by liraglutide.	In a clinical trial, one patient with type 2 diabetes experienced a single overdose of Victoza 17.4 mg subcutaneous (10 times the maximum recommended dose). Effects of the overdose included severe nausea and vomiting requiring hospitalization. No hypoglycemia was reported. The patient recovered without complications. In the event of overdosage, appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated according to the patient's clinical signs and symptoms. RISK OF THYROID C-CELL TUMORS	During the initial 24 hours following administration of a single [3H]-liraglutide dose to healthy subjects, the major component in plasma was intact liraglutide. Liraglutide is endogenously metabolized in a similar manner to large proteins without a specific organ as a major route of elimination.	Maximum concentrations of liraglutide are achieved at 8-12 hours after dose. The mean peak and total exposures of liraglutide were 35 ng/mL and 960 ng·h/mL, respectively, for a subQ single dose of 0.6 mg. After subcutaneous single dose administrations, Cmax and AUC of liraglutide increased proportionally over the therapeutic dose range of 0.6 mg to 1.8 mg. At 1.8 mg Victoza, the average steady state concentration of liraglutide over 24 hours was approximately 128 ng/mL AUC0-∞ was equivalent between upper arm and abdomen, and between upper arm and thigh. AUC0-∞ from thigh was 22% lower than that from abdomen. Absolute bioavailability of liraglutide following subcutaneous administration is approximately 55%.

The recombinant peptide precursor of liraglutide, produced by its expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, has been engineered to be 97% homologous to native human GLP-1 by substituting R for K at position 34. Liraglutide was designed by attaching a C-16 fatty acid (palmitic acid) with a glutamic acid spacer on the remaining lysine residue at position 26 of the peptide precursor.	For use in/treatment of diabetes mellitus type 2.	Liraglutide is a once-daily GLP-1 derivative for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

Thus golimumab is indicated for use in adults (i) as an adjunct to methotrexate treatment in patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis (RA), (ii) alone or as an adjunct to methotrexate treatment in patients with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA), (iii) as a single agent in patients with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS), and (iv) as a single agent in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (UC) who require chronic steroids or have experienced intolerance or only a partial response to previous medications. In the U.S. and Canada, golimumab is marketed under the brand name Simponi. The FDA label includes a black box warning of serious infections and malignancy. Additionally in children and adolescents taking golimumab, there have been lymphoma and other malignancies observed.	Used in adults (i) as an adjunct to methotrexate treatment in patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis (RA), (ii) alone or as an adjunct to methotrexate treatment in patients with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA), (iii) as a single agent in patients with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS), and (iv) as a single agent in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (UC) who require chronic steroids or have experienced intolerance or only a partial response to previous medications.	Golimumab inhibits the activity of the cytokine, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα). In areas such as the joints and blood, increased TNFαis associated with chronic inflammation seen in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis. Thus golimumab decreases the inflammation in these conditions. Concerning ulcerative colitis, the physiological effects of golimumab has yet to be determined.	As a human monoclonal antibody, golimumab binds and inhibits soluble and transmembrane human TNFα. Inhibition of TNFα prevents it binding to its receptors, which prevents both leukocyte infiltration through prevention of cell adhesion proteins such as E-selectin, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, and pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion such as IL-6, IL-8, G-CSF and GM-CSF in vitro. Consequently, in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions, decreases in ICAM-1 and IL-6 as well as C-reactive protein (CRP), matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP-3), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were observed.	The FDA label includes a black box warning of serious infections and malignancy. Specifically there have been hospitalizations or death from infections such as bacterial sepsis, tuberculosis (TB), and invasive fungal (histoplasmosis) and other opportunistic infections. Additionally in children and adolescents taking golimumab, there have been lymphoma and other malignancies observed.	The metabolism of golimumab has yet to be determined.	After subcutaneous administration, golimumab can achieve maximum serum concentrations in 2 to 6 days and has an approximate bioavailability of 53%. In healthy volunteers, the maximum average concentration reached was 3.2 ± 1.4 μg/mL.	After IV administration, golimumab has a volume of distribution of about 58 to 126 mL/kg. This means that golimumab stays mostly in the circulatory system.	After one IV dose of golimumab, the systemic clearance was about 4.9 to 6.7 mL/day/kg.

Belatacept is a recombinant (CHO cells derived) soluble fusion protein, which links the extracellular domain of human cytotoxic CTLA-4 to the modified Fc portion of human IgG1, thereby  selectively blocking the process of T-cell activation. It is a glycosylated fusion protein, which is a homodimer of two homologous polypeptide chains of 357 amino acids each. The drug acts as a selective co-stimulation modulator with inhibitory activity on T lymphocytes. It differs from abatacept (Orencia) by only 2 amino acids. It is approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. It was developed by Bristol-Myers-Squibb. FDA approved on June 15, 2011.	For prophylaxis of organ rejection. It is also used concomitantly with basiliximumab for induction therapy, mycophenolate, and corticosteriods in kidney transplant recepients that are seropositive for the Epstein-Barr virus.	Belatacept binds to CD86 with a 4-fold higher affinity than abatacept. It also binds to CD80 with a 2-fold higher affinity than abatacept. It was observed in non-human primates that belatacept prolongs graft survival due to a decrease in antibody production against the donor organ. Furthermore, belatacept also inhibits the primary humoral immune response which is indicated by the decrease in post-transplant levels of IgG, IgM, and IgA. The magnitude of this effect is more significant in belatacept than it is in cyclosporine.	Belatacept is a fusion protein in which the Fc portion of human IgG1 is attached onto the extracellular portion of human CTLA-4 (CD152). Belatacept specifically binds to CD80 and CD86 receptors that are found on the antigen-presenting cell (B cells, macrophages, dendritic cells) to block selective T-cell lymphocyte costimulation. CD80 and CD86 would normally act as the ligands to the CD28 receptor T-cells in which this interaction triggers the activation of T lymphocytes. However in the presence of belatacept, because the extracellular CTLA-4 component binds to CD28 with higher affinity than CD80 or CD86, T lymphyocyte anergy, a state of antigen specific tolerance, occurs instead. The T cell is also no longer able to respond to their antigen.	N.A.	The cytochrome P450 enzyme system or uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferases are not expected to be involved with the metabolism of belatacept. Because the drug is a protein, belatacept is degraded into smaller peptides and amino acids by proteolytic enzymes.	Following multiple intravenous doses of an initial 10 mg/kg dose and followed by a maintenance dose of 5 mg/kg in kidney transplant recipients, these are the following pharmacokinetic parameters: Cmax, 10 mg/kg = 247 µg/mL; Cmax, 5 mg/kg = 139 µg/mL; AUC, 10 mg/kg = 22,252 µg · h/mL; AUC, 5 mg/kg = 14,090  µg · h/mL; Belatacept had linear and dose-dependent pharmacokinetic profile.

T-lymphocyte activation antigen CD86,T-lymphocyte activation antigen CD80	Nulojix	Bristol-Myers Squibb	NULOJIX (belatacept), a selective T-cell costimulation blocker, is a soluble fusion protein consisting of the modified extracellular domain of CTLA-4 fused to a portion (hinge-CH2-CH3 domains) of the Fc domain of a human immunoglobulin G1 antibody. Belatacept is produced by recombinant DNA technology in a mammalian cell expression system. Two amino acid substitutions (L104 to E; A29 to Y) were made in the ligand binding region of CTLA-4. As a result of these modifications, belatacept binds CD80 and CD86 more avidly than abatacept, the parent CTLA4-Immunoglobulin (CTLA4-Ig) molecule from which it is derived. The molecular weight of belatacept is approximately 90 kilodaltons.	NULOJIX (belatacept) is indicated for prophylaxis of organ rejection in adult patients receiving a kidney transplant. NULOJIX is to be used in combination with basiliximab induction, mycophenolate mofetil, and corticosteroids.	N.A.	Prior to use, the lyophile is reconstituted with a suitable fluid to obtain a clear to slightly opalescent, colorless to pale yellow solution, with a pH in the range of 7.2 to 7.8.

N.A.	N.A.	Intravitreal half life - 7.13 days	Aflibercept is a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor. It is a recombinant dimeric fusion glycoprotein that comprises (VEGF) binding portions from the extracellular domains of human VEGF receptors 1 and 2, this is fused to the Fc portion of human IgG1. It contains approximately 15% glycosylation to give a total molecular weight of 115 kDa (protein part = 96.9 kDa). It has 5 putative N-glycosylation sites on each polypeptide chain and the attached carbohydrates exhibit some degree of chain heterogeneity, including heterogeneity in terminal sialic acid residues, except at the site associated with the Fc domain, which is unsialylated.	The opthalmic agent is used for the treatment of neovascular (wet) age-related mascular degeneration (AMD) and macular edema following central retinal vein occulsion (CRVO). The systemic injection, known as ziv-aflibercept, in combination with 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan-(FOLFIRI), is for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer that is resistant to or progressed following treatment with oxaliplatin.	Compared to other anti-VEGF drugs like bevacizumab and ranibizumab, aflibercept has a higher binding affinity to VEGF-A (Kd = 0.5 pM).	Ablibercept is a recombinant fusion protein that acts as a decoy receptor for the ligands, vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) and placental growth factor (PIGF). It prevents these ligands to binding to endothelial receptors, VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2, to suppress neovascularization and decrease vascular permeability. This ultimately will slow vision loss or the progression of metastatic colorectal cancer.	For all intravitreal VEGF inhibitors, there is increased risk of stroke and myocardial infarction. An increase in intraocular pressure may also occur. When used intravenously, most common adverse reactions were leukopenia, diarrhea, neutropenia, proteinuria, AST increased, stomatitis, fatigue, thrombocytopenia, ALT increased, hypertension, weight decreased, decreased appetite, epistaxis, abdominal pain, dysphonia, serum creatinine increased, and headache.	Because aflibercept is a protein, it is expected to be broken down via proteolysis into smaller peptides and amino acids. The cytochrome P450 enzyme system is not involved in the metabolism of aflibercept.	In patients with wet AMD and CRVO, the mean peak plasma concentration (Cmax) was 0.02 mcg/mL and 0.05 mcg/mL respectively. These concentrations were reached in 1 to 3 days. Aflibercept did not accumulate when administered as repeated doses intravitreally every 4 weeks.	After Intravenous infusion of aflibercept, the volume of distribution is 6 L.	When cancer patients were given 2-9 mg/kg every 2 or 3 week; 1 hour IV infusion of aflibercept the typical estimated clearances were as follows:CL of free aflibercept (CLf) = 0.88 L/day;CL of bound aflibercept (CLf) = 0.19 L/day;Patients clear free aflibercept faster if they had low albumin or high alkaline phosphatase levels.

It is a recombinant dimeric fusion glycoprotein that comprises (VEGF) binding portions from the extracellular domains of human VEGF receptors 1 and 2, this is fused to the Fc portion of human IgG1. It contains approximately 15% glycosylation to give a total molecular weight of 115 kDa (protein part = 96.9 kDa). It has 5 putative N-glycosylation sites on each polypeptide chain and the attached carbohydrates exhibit some degree of chain heterogeneity, including heterogeneity in terminal sialic acid residues, except at the site associated with the Fc domain, which is unsialylated	The opthalmic agent is used for the treatment of neovascular (wet) age-related mascular degeneration (AMD) and macular edema following central retinal vein occulsion (CRVO). The systemic injection, known as ziv-aflibercept, in combination with 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan-(FOLFIRI), is for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer that is resistant to or progressed following treatment with oxaliplatin.	Compared to other anti-VEGF drugs like bevacizumab and ranibizumab, aflibercept has a higher binding affinity to VEGF-A (Kd = 0.5 pM).	Ablibercept is a recombinant fusion protein that acts as a decoy receptor for the ligands, vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) and placental growth factor (PIGF). It prevents these ligands to binding to endothelial receptors, VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2, to suppress neovascularization and decrease vascular permeability. This ultimately will slow vision loss or the progression of metastatic colorectal cancer.	For all intravitreal VEGF inhibitors, there is increased risk of stroke and myocardial infarction. An increase in intraocular pressure may also occur. When used intravenously, most common adverse reactions were leukopenia, diarrhea, neutropenia, proteinuria, AST increased, stomatitis, fatigue, thrombocytopenia, ALT increased, hypertension, weight decreased, decreased appetite, epistaxis, abdominal pain, dysphonia, serum creatinine increased, and headache.	Because aflibercept is a protein, it is expected to be broken down via proteolysis into smaller peptides and amino acids. The cytochrome P450 enzyme system is not involved in the metabolism of aflibercept.	In patients with wet AMD and CRVO, the mean peak plasma concentration (Cmax) was 0.02 mcg/mL and 0.05 mcg/mL respectively. These concentrations were reached in 1 to 3 days.

L-asparaginase is a homo-tetramer with each subnuit having a molecular weight of about 35 kDa. It is an antineoplastic agent and was FDA approved in November 19, 2011.	Asparaginase Erwinia chryanthemi is for the treatment of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) that have developed a hypersensitivity to Escherichia coli-derivied asparaginase. It is a component of a multi-agent chemotherpeutic regimen for the treatment of the aforementioned disease and is considered second- or third- line treatment in European and American protocols.	N.A.	Asparaginase Erwinia chrysanthemi catalyzes the deamidation of asparagine to aspartic acid and ammonia, resulting in a reduction in circulating levels of asparagine in the plasma. The mechanism of action of Erwinaze is thought to be based on the inability of leukemic cells to synthesize asparagine due to lack of asparagine synthetase activity, resulting in cytotoxicity specific for leukemic cells that depend on an exogenous source of the amino acid asparagine for their protein metabolism and survival.	Because Erwinaze is injected intramuscularly, there is a higher chance of experiencing major skin reactions. Although the perceived benefit of Erwinia chryanthemi-derivied asparaginase is a lower incidence of hypersensitivity, there is still a chance that one may experience symptoms such as, but not limited to, anaphylaxis, pain, edema.

Recombinant (E.coli derived), Intermediate-acting insulin to improve glycemic control. It consists of a crystalline suspension of human insulin with protamine and zinc, which results in an intermediate-acting insulin with a slower onset of action and longer duration of activity compared to regular human insulin.	Used to improve glycemic control in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus.	When 0.3 Units/kg of NPH insulin was subcutaneously administered, the onset of action was approximately 0.8 hours. The duration of action was 13.2 hours. The peak activity of NPH insulin occurs 4-6 hours post-dose. Compared to insulin glargine, NPH insulin has a quicker onset of action and shorter duration of action.	The primary activity of insulin is the regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulin promotes glucose and amino acid uptake into muscle and adipose tissues, and other tissues except brain and liver. It also has an anabolic role in stimulating glycogen, fatty acid, and protein synthesis. Insulin inhibits gluconeogenesis in the liver. Insulin binds to the insulin receptor (IR), a heterotetrameric protein consisting of two extracellular alpha units and two transmembrane beta units. The binding of insulin to the alpha subunit of IR stimulates the tyrosine kinase activity intrinsic to the beta subunit of the receptor. The bound receptor is able to autophosphorylate and phosphorylate numerous intracellular substrates such as insulin receptor substrates (IRS) proteins, Cbl, APS, Shc and Gab 1. These activated proteins, in turn, lead to the activation of downstream signaling molecules including PI3 kinase and Akt. Akt regulates the activity of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and protein kinase C (PKC) which play a critical role in metabolism and catabolism	Hypoglycemia is one of the most frequent adverse events experienced by insulin users.	Insulin is predominantly cleared by metabolic degradation via a receptor-mediated process.	NPH insulin is generally well and rapidly absorbed from the site of injection. Absorption does not differ if it is subcutaneously administered in the thigh or abdomen. when 0.5 IU/kg of NPH insulin was given to adult type 1 diabetes patients before breakfast, the pharmacokinetic parameters are as follows: AUC (0-24hours) = 111,941 ± 77,941 pmol · l-1 · min-1; Cmax = 149 ± 121 pmol/l; Tmax = 480 ± 237 minute. It is important to note that NPH insulin has a high degree of patient variability in its absorption profile.	0.15 L/kg	N.A.	Hypoglycemic Agents and Antidiabetic Agents	N.A.	N.A.	N.A.	N.A.	Insulin receptor	Novolin N	Novo Nordisk	It is an intermediate-acting insulin administered to control blood sugar level in diabetic patient. It was created by adding neutral protamine to regular procine insulin. Insulin isophane is a man-made form of a hormone that is produced in the body. It works by lowering levels of glucose (sugar) in the blood. Insulin isophane is a long-acting form of insulin that is slightly different from other forms of insulin that are not man-made. Insulin isophane is used to treat diabetes. Insulin isophane may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide. This package contains Novolin N in an InnoLet disposable prefilled insulin syringe. Novolin N is commonly known as NPH, Human Insulin Isophane Suspension (recombinant DNA origin). The concentration of this product is 100 units of insulin per milliliter. It is a cloudy or milky suspension of human insulin with protamine and zinc. The insulin substance (the cloudy material) settles at the bottom of the insulin reservoir, therefore, the Novolin N InnoLet (nph, human insulin isophane suspension 3 ml disposable prefilled syringe) must be rotated up and down so that the contents are uniformly mixed before a dose is given. Novolin N has an intermediate duration of action. The effect of Novolin N begins approximately 1½ hours after injection. The effect is maximal between 4 and 12 hours. The full duration of action may last up to 24 hours after injection. The time course of action of any insulin may vary considerably in different individuals, or at different times in the same individual. Because of this variation, the time periods listed here should be considered as general guidance only. This human insulin (recombinant DNA origin) is structurally identical to the insulin produced by the human pancreas. This human insulin is produced by recombinant DNA technology utilizing Saccharomyces cerevisiae (bakers' yeast) as the production organism.	Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, 	N.A.

Activated STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) proteins are then translocated to the nucleus where they serve as transcription factors which regulate the activation of specific genes involved in cell division or differentiation.

Erythropoietin for clinical use is produced by recombinant DNA technology using mammalian cells as expression system. All epoetins in clinical use have an amino acid sequence similar to endogenous erythropoietin but differ in the glycosylation pattern. Glycosylation influences pharmacokinetics and may affect efficacy and safety, particularly immunogenicity. The active substance in SB309 (Epoetin zeta) is a recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) of identical primary structure produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. The molecular weight of the glycosylated protein is 30.6 kDa. The oligosaccharide chains are subject to posttranslational modifications and display heterogeneity to a certain extent. To support the claim that Retacrit is biosimilar to the reference medicinal product Erypo with regard to quality, safety and efficacy, the applicant has submitted a comparability exercise for a similar biological medicinal product versus the reference medicinal product. The main clinical data for the application submitted by the applicant consists of two pharmacokinetic (PK) trials comparing the PK profiles of SB309 and Erypo after single dose administration, and two phase III trials (one correction phase study and one maintenance phase study) comparing efficacy and safety of intravenously (IV) administered SB309 and Erypo in patients with renal anaemia.

N.A.	28.4 days	Humanized monoclonal antibody used along with chlorambucil for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. It was approved by the FDA in November 2013 and is marketed under the brand name Gazyva. It carries a black box warning of fatal Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) reactivation and fatal Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML).	Obinutuzumab is used as a combination treatment with chlorambucil to treat patients with untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia.	Obinutuzumab is more potent than rituximab in depleting B-cells, antitumor activity, and tumor regression.	In contrast to rituximab, which is a classic type I CD20 antibody, obinutuzumab binds to type II CD20 antibodies. This allows obinutuzumab to have a much higher induction of antibody-dependant cytotoxicity and a higher direct cytotoxic effect than the classic CD20 antibodies.	The most serious toxicities observed with obinutuzumab are Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). HBV reactivation can occur with all anti-CD20 antibodies and can result in hepatic failure, fulminant hepatitis, and death. PML occurs as a result of JC virus infection and can be fatal as well. Other common but less serious adverse reactions include infusion reactions (pre-treat with glucocorticoids, acetaminophen, and anti-histamine to prevent this), neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS) (pre-treat patients, especially with a high lymphocyte count and/or a high tumor burden, with anti-hyperuricemics and hydration). It is also recommended to NOT administer live virus vaccinations prior to or during obinutuzumab treatment.	Obinutuzumab is not metabolized by the liver.	Obinutuzumab is administered intravenously, so its absorption is 100%.	Obinutuzumab has a volume of distribution of about 3.8 L.	The clearance of obinutuzumab is 0.09L/day.	Antineoplastic Agents	N.A.

It consists of two non-covalently linked, non-identical glycoproteins designated as the alpha (92 amino acids)- and beta (111 amino acids)- subunits. The alpha subunit is glycosylated at N51 and N78 while the beta subunit is glycosylated at N7 and N24. Follitropin alpha was the world's first recombinant human FSH preparation. The term “alpha” differentiates it from another recombinant human FSH product that was marketed later as follitropin beta. Follitropin is important in the development of follicles produced by the ovaries. Given by subcutaneous injection, it is used in combination with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) to assist in ovulation and fertility. Follitropin may also be used to cause the ovary to produce several follicles, which can then be harvested for use in gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT) or in vitro fertilization (IVF). Numerous physio-chemical tests and bioassays indicate that follitropin beta and follitropin alpha are indistinguishable. However, a more recent study showed there is may be a slight clinical difference, with the alpha form tending towards a higher pregnancy rate than beta but with significantly higher estradiol (E2) levels. The amino acid sequence of follitropin beta is identical to that of natural human follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). Further, the ogliosaccharide side-chains are very similar, but not completely identical to that of natural FSH. However, these small differences do not affect the bioactivity compared to natural FSH.	In women having been diagnosed with primary ovarian failure, it is used in combination with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) to assist in ovulation and fertility. In men with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism, it is used to induce spermatogenesis. Follitropin may also be used to cause the ovary to produce several follicles, which can then be harvested for use in gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT) or in vitro fertilization (IVF)	The main pharmacodynamic parameters are serum inhibin, estradiol and total follicular volume with daily injections of follitropin. The quickest response was noticed with serum inhibin, which declined rapidly after discontinuation. Follicular growth showed late response and continued even after discontinuation of the drug and after decline of the serum concentrations. Thus follicular growth was better correlated with serum inhibin and estradiol rather than peal levels of the drug.

Immunen thrombocytopenia patients, subQ = 3.5 days (median) (range 1-34 days)	Romiplostim is a thrombopoiesis stimulating dimer Fc-peptide fusion protein (peptibody) to increase platelet production through activation of the thrombopoietin receptor. The peptibody molecule has two identical single-chain subunits, each one is made up of 269 amino acid residues. Each subunit consists of an IgG1 Fc carrier domain that is covalently attached to a polypeptide sequence that contains two binding domains to interact with thrombopoietin receptor c-Mpl. Each domain consists of 14 amino acids. Interestingly, romiplostim's amino acid sequence is not similar to that of endogenous thrombopoietin. Romiplostim is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Escherichia coli. FDA approved on August 22, 2008.	Treatment of chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura.	Responses to platelet increase varies between patients thus indicating a need for individualization of dose. However, a dose dependent-increase in platelet counts have been observed in clinical trials. Does not affect platelet destruction.	Romiplostim is a thrombopoietin receptor agonist that activates intracellular transcriptional pathways via c-Mpl to increase production of platelets. It also works similarly to thrombopoietin (TPO), an endogenous glycoprotein hormone that regulates the production of platelets in the bone marrow.	The most common adverse reactions ( higher patient incidence in Nplate versus placebo) are arthralgia, dizziness, insomnia, myalgia, pain in extremity, abdominal pain, shoulder pain, dyspepsia, and paresthesia.

Administer Nplate as a weekly subcutaneous injection with dose adjustments based upon the platelet count response. The prescribed Nplate dose may consist of a very small volume (eg, 0.15 mL). Administer Nplate only with a syringe that contains 0.01 mL graduations. The initial dose for Nplate is 1 mcg/kg based on actual body weight. Dose AdjustmentsUse the actual body weight at initiation of therapy, then adjust the weekly dose of Nplate by increments of 1 mcg/kg until the patient achieves a platelet count ≥ 50 x 109/L as necessary to reduce the risk for bleeding; do not exceed a maximum weekly dose of 10 mcg/kg. In clinical studies, most patients who responded to Nplate achieved and maintained platelet counts ≥ 50 x 109/L with a median dose of 2 mcg/kg. During Nplate therapy, assess CBCs, including platelet counts, weekly until a stable platelet count ( ≥ 50 x 109/L for at least 4 weeks without dose adjustment) has been achieved. Obtain CBCs, including platelet counts, monthly thereafter.	N.A.	The following serious adverse reactions: Progression of Myelodysplastic Syndromes, Thrombotic/Thromboembolic Complications, Loss of Response to Nplate, Overdoses due to medication errors have been reported in patients receiving Nplate.

It contains sinapultide, a novel, hydrophobic, 21-amino acid peptide (leucine and lysine repeating units, KL4 peptide) designed to mimic human surfactant protein-B (SB-P). It specifically mimics the C-terminal amphipathic helical domain of this protein. It also consists of phospholipids (dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, DPPC and palmitoyloleoyl phosphatidylglycerol,POPG) and a fatty acid (palmitic acid). It is completely devoid of animal-derived components. FDA approved it on March 6, 2012.	Intended for the prevention of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in premature infants at high risk for RDS.	Lucinactant is a new synthetic surfactant containing a protein that mimics human surfactant protein-B, is effective at preventing respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and related complications in preterm infants. Lucinactant has been shown to have antiinflammatory properties, is resistant to proteolytic degradation and oxidation, and has no potential for transmitting animal-derived diseases. Lucinactant has proven safe and effective in the prevention of RDS in preterm infants and as a treatment for MAS in full-term infants and for adult ARDS.	Pulmonary surfactant is a lipoprotein complex that is produced naturally in the lungs, where it lines the alveolar epithelium and serves to reduce surface tension, which facilitates alveoli expansion and allows gas exchange. Human surfactants contain phospholipids, predominantly dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), in addition to surfactant proteins A, B, C and D. Surfactant is also a physical barrier to inhaled particle and noxious agents, enhances particle clearance, is involved in host defense against infection and possesses antiinflammatory properties. Several serious respiratory disorders have been associated with a loss or lack of endogenous surfactant. Lucinactant was designed to mimic the essential endogenous human surfactant protein B (SP-B).

N.A.	N.A.	N.A.	A human monoclonal antibody, secukinumab (cosentyx) was designed for the treatment of uveitis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and psoriasis. Secukinumab is an interleukin-17A inhibitor marketed by Novartis. On January 19, 2015, secukinumab was approved by the European Commission as a first line systemic treatment in moderate to severe adult plaque psoriasis. On January 21, 2015, the United States Food and Drug Administration announced that it had approved secukinumab to treat adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.	It is a human interleukin-17A antagonist indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adult patients who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy.	Elevated levels of IL-17A are found in psoriatic plaques. Treatment with cosentyx may reduce epidermal neutrophils and IL-17A levels in psoriatic plaques. Serum levels of total IL-17A (free and secukinumab-bound IL-17A) measured at Week 4 and Week 12 were increased following secukinumab treatment. These pharmacodynamic activities are based on small exploratory studies. The relationship between these pharmacodynamic activities and the mechanism(s) by which secukinumab exerts its clinical effects is unknown.	Secukinumab is a human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to the interleukin-17A (IL-17A) cytokine and inhibits its interaction with the IL-17 receptor. IL-17A is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in normal inflammatory and immune responses. Secukinumab inhibits the release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines.	N.A.	N.A.	N.A.

Somatropin (rDNA origin - nonrefrigerated) is a growth hormone. It works by increasing the flow of water, electrolytes, and nutrients into the bowels.	For treatment of dwarfism, acromegaly and prevention of HIV-induced weight loss	Used in the treatment of dwarfism and growth failure, growth hormone (hGH) stimulates skeletal growth in pediatric patients with growth failure due to a lack of adequate secretion of endogenous GH. Skeletal growth is accomplished at the epiphyseal plates at the ends of a growing bone. Growth and metabolism of epiphyseal plate cells are directly stimulated by GH and one of its mediators, IGF-I (insulin-like growth factor).	hGH binds to the human growth hormone receptor (GHR). Upon binding, hGH causes dimerization of GHR, activation of the GHR-associated JAK2 tyrosine kinase, and tyrosyl phosphorylation of both JAK2 and GHR. These events recruit and/or activate a variety of signaling molecules, including MAP kinases, insulin receptor substrates, phosphatidylinositol 3' phosphate kinase, diacylglycerol, protein kinase C, intracellular calcium, and Stat transcription factors. These signaling molecules contribute to the GH-induced changes in enzymatic activity, transport function, and gene expression that ultimately culminate in changes in growth and metabolism.	N.A.	Both the liver and kidney have been shown to be important metabolizing organs for GH. Animal studies suggest that the kidney is the dominant organ of clearance. GH is filtered at the glomerulus and reabsorbed in the proximal tubules. It is then cleaved within renal cells into its constituent amino acids, which return to the systemic circulation.	The absolute bioavailability of somatropin after subcutaneous administration in healthy adult males has been determined to be 81 ± 20%. The mean terminal t1/2 after subcutaneous administration is significantly longer than that seen after intravenous administration (2.1 ± 0.43 hours vs. 19.5 ± 3.1 minutes) indicating that the subcutaneous absorption of the compound is slow and rate-limiting.

N.A.	>100	Plasma half life: 150 minutes, Elimination half life: 10hrs	Aprotinin, also known as bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, BPTI (Trasylol, Bayer) is a protein, that is used as medication administered by injection to reduce bleeding during complex surgery, such as heart and liver surgery. Its main effect is the slowing down of fibrinolysis, the process that leads to the breakdown of blood clots. The aim in its use is to decrease the need for blood transfusions during surgery, as well as end-organ damage due to hypotension (low blood pressure) as a result of marked blood loss.	For prophylactic use to reduce perioperative blood loss and the need for blood transfusion in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass in the course of coronary artery bypass graft surgery who are at an increased risk for blood loss and blood transfusion.	Aprotinin is a broad spectrum protease inhibitor which modulates the systemic inflammatory response (SIR) associated with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) surgery. SIR results in the interrelated activation of the hemostatic, fibrinolytic, cellular and humoral inflammatory systems. Aprotinin, through its inhibition of multiple mediators [e.g., kallikrein, plasmin] results in the attenuation of inflammatory responses, fibrinolysis, and thrombin generation. Aprotinin inhibits pro-inflammatory cytokine release and maintains glycoprotein homeostasis. In platelets, aprotinin reduces glycoprotein loss (e.g., GpIb, GpIIb/IIIa), while in granulocytes it prevents the expression of pro-inflammatory adhesive glycoproteins.	Aprotinin inhibits several serine proteases, specifically trypsin, chymotrypsin and plasmin at a concentration of about 125,000 IU/ml, and kallikrein at 300,000 IU/ml. Its action on kallikrein leads to the inhibition of the formation of factor XIIa. As a result, both the intrinsic pathway of coagulation and fibrinolysis are inhibited. Its action on plasmin independently slows fibrinolysis.	N.A.	Aprotinin is slowly degraded by lysosomal enzymes.	100%(IV)	N.A.	N.A.	N.A.	US5198534	30/03/93	N.A.

Recombinant humanized IgG4, kappa antibody conjugated with a cytotoxic antitumor antibiotic, calicheamicin, isolated from fermentation of a bacterium, Micromonospora echinospora ssp. calichensis. The antibody portion of Mylotarg binds specifically to the CD33 antigen, The anti-CD33 hP67.6 antibody is produced by mammalian cell suspension culture using a myeloma NS0 cell line.	For treatment of CD33-positive acute myeloid leukemia in patients 60 and over who are not candidates for other chemotherapy.	Used for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), mylotarg binds to the CD33 antigen, which is expressed on the surface of leukemic cells in more than 80% of patients with AML. The CD33 antigen is not expressed on pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells or nonhematopoietic cells. This gives mylotarg the selectivity needed to target leukemic cells.	Mylotarg is directed against the CD33 antigen expressed by hematopoietic cells. Binding of the anti-CD33 antibody portion of Mylotarg with the CD33 antigen results in the formation of a complex that is internalized. Upon internalization, the calicheamicin derivative is released inside the lysosomes of the myeloid cell. The released calicheamicin derivative binds to DNA in the minor groove resulting in DNA double strand breaks and cell death.

As statin therapy increases the production of PCSK9, statin co-administration is thought to shorten alirocumab half-life; therefore the median apparent half-life of alirocumab was reduced to 12 days at equivalent alirocumab doses. However, this difference is not considered clinically significant and does not change dosing recommendations.	Alirocumab is a biopharmaceutical drug approved by the FDA in July 2015 as a second line treatment for high cholesterol for adults whose LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) is not controlled by diet and statin treatment. It is a human monoclonal antibody administered by subcutaneous injection that belongs to a novel class of anti-cholesterol drugs, known as PCSK9 inhibitors, and it was the first such agent to receive FDA approval. The FDA approval was contingent on the completion of further clinical trials to better determine efficacy and safety. PCSK9 inhibition facilitates more LDL-C clearance from the blood.	Alirocumab is indicated as an adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy in adults who require additional LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering due to heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.	Alirocumab reduces levels of PCSK9 in a concentration-dependent manner.	Alirocumab is a fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds and inhibits proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), an enzyme found to have gain of function mutations in autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia. PCSK9 is secreted by the liver and typically binds to the LDL receptors in serum and marks them for lysosomal degradation. In result, the LDL receptors are not able to recycle to the plasma membrane, reducing their binding to LDL-C and therefore reducing the clearance of LDL-C from plasma. Therefore by inhibiting PCSK9's actions, alirocumab allows for more LDL-C reuptake by the liver and facilitates a higher rate of clearance. Lower LDL cholesterol concentrations are associated with a reduced risk of coronary heart disease.	During a 13-week toxicology study of 75 mg/kg once weekly alirocumab in combination with 40 mg/kg once daily atorvastatin in adult monkeys, there were no effects of PRALUENT on the humoral immune response to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) after one to two months at exposures 100-fold greater than the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose of 150 mg every two weeks, based on AUC.	Antibodies are generally metabolized by the reticuloendothelial system and degraded into small peptides and individual amino acids - therefore specific metabolism studies were not conducted. Alirocumab did not show evidence of affecting CYP 450 enzymes or transporter proteins in co-administration with statins.	Following subcutaneous (SC) administration, alirocumab is absorbed into the bloodstream and maximum concentrations are reached at a median time of 3-7 days.

1685	Th1164	Antithrombin Alfa	NA	Ia	57,215	C2191H3457N583O656S20	NA	NA	NA	11.6 (84.7) for 50 IU/KG to17.7 (60.9) for 100IU/KG	Antithrombin (Recombinant) and plasma-derived antithrombin both contain six cysteine residues forming three disulphide bridges and 3-4 N-linked carbohydrate moieties. The glycosylation profile of antithrombin (Recombinant) is different from plasma-derived antithrombin, which results in an increased heparin affinity. When assayed in the presence of excess of heparin the potency of the recombinant product is not different from that of plasma-derived product.	Indicated for the prevention of peri-operative and peri-partum thromboembolic events in hereditary antithrombin deficient patients	Hereditary AT deficiency causes an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). During high-risk situations such as surgery or trauma or for pregnant women, during the peripartum period, the risk of development of VTEs as compared to the normal population in these situations is increased by a factor 10 to 506,7. In hereditary antithrombin deficient patients ATryn restores (normalizes) plasma AT activity levels during peri-operative and peri-partum periods.	Antithrombin (AT) plays a central role in the regulation of hemostasis. AT is the principal inhibitor of thrombin and Factor Xa5, the serine proteases that play pivotal roles in blood coagulation. AT neutralizes the activity of thrombin and Factor Xa by forming a complex which is rapidly removed from the circulation. The ability of antithrombin to inhibit thrombin and Factor Xa can be enhanced by greater than 300 to 1000 fold when AT is bound to heparin.	The toxicological profile of antithrombin (Recombinant) administered by the intravenous route as bolus injections and infusions has been evaluated in both single- and repeat-dose studies performed in rats, dogs, and monkeys across a range of doses from 2.1 to 360 mg/kg. The highest doses in the single dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs were 360 mg/kg and 210 mg/kg, respectively. Toxicities observed were limited to transient injection site swelling observed in rats and dogs at the highest doses tested, and increased AST at highest dose in the dog study, both resolved during recovery period. The highest dose in the 28-day repeated-dose toxicity study in rats was 360 mg/kg/day. The toxicity at this dose was limited to transient limb swelling and local injection site bruising and swelling. The highest dose in the 14-day repeated-dose toxicity study in monkeys was 300 mg/kg/day or approximately 7-8 times human dose. Toxicities observed in female monkeys at this dose included internal bleeding, hematological changes and liver toxicity, with one out of three female animals showing multifocal hepatic necrosis. Both sexes showed increased AST and ALK on day 15, with both parameters returning to normal by day 22. There was no adverse effect in monkeys dosed with 120 mg/kg/day.

Asfotase Alfa is a first-in-class bone-targeted enzyme replacement therapy designed to address the underlying cause of hypophosphatasia (HPP)—deficient alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Hypophosphatasia is almost always fatal when severe skeletal disease is obvious at birth. By replacing deficient ALP, treatment with Asfotase Alfa aims to improve the elevated enzyme substrate levels and improve the body’s ability to mineralize bone, thereby preventing serious skeletal and systemic patient morbidity and premature death. Asfotase alfa was first approved by Pharmaceuticals and Medicals Devices Agency of Japan (PMDA) on July 3, 2015, then approved by the European Medicine Agency (EMA) on August 28, 2015, and was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on October 23, 2015.	Indicated for the treatment of patients with perinatal/infantile and juvenile onset hypophosphatasia (HPP).	Perinatal/infantile- and juvenile-onset HPP patients treated with Asfotase alfa had reductions in plasma TNSALP (tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase) substrates, PPi and pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) within 6 to 12 weeks of treatment. Reductions in plasma PPi and PLP levels did not correlate with clinical outcomes. Bone biopsy data from perinatal/infantile-onset and juvenile-onset HPP patients treated with Asfotase alfa demonstrated decreases in osteoid volume and thickness indicating improved bone mineralization.	HPP is caused by a deficiency in TNSALP (tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase) enzyme activity, which leads to elevations in several TNSALP substrates, including inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi). Elevated extracellular levels of PPi block hydroxyapatite crystal growth which inhibits bone mineralization and causes an accumulation of unmineralized bone matrix which manifests as rickets and bone deformation in infants and children and as osteomalacia (softening of bones) once growth plates close, along with muscle weakness. Replacement of the TNSALP enzyme upon Asfotase alfa treatment reduces the enzyme substrate levels.	There are no available human data on Asfotase Alfa use in pregnant women to inform a drug associated risk. In animal reproduction studies, Asfotase Alfa administered intravenously to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis showed no evidence of fetotoxicity, embryolethality or teratogenicity at doses causing plasma exposures up to 21 and 24 times, respectively, the exposure at the recommended human dose.

By replacing deficient ALP, treatment with Asfotase Alfa aims to improve the elevated enzyme substrate levels and improve the body’s ability to mineralize bone, thereby preventing serious skeletal and systemic patient morbidity and premature death. Asfotase alfa was first approved by Pharmaceuticals and Medicals Devices Agency of Japan (PMDA) on July 3, 2015, then approved by the European Medicine Agency (EMA) on August 28, 2015, and was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on October 23, 2015.	Indicated for the treatment of patients with perinatal/infantile and juvenile onset hypophosphatasia (HPP).	Perinatal/infantile- and juvenile-onset HPP patients treated with Asfotase alfa had reductions in plasma TNSALP (tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase) substrates, PPi and pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) within 6 to 12 weeks of treatment. Reductions in plasma PPi and PLP levels did not correlate with clinical outcomes. Bone biopsy data from perinatal/infantile-onset and juvenile-onset HPP patients treated with Asfotase alfa demonstrated decreases in osteoid volume and thickness indicating improved bone mineralization.	HPP is caused by a deficiency in TNSALP (tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase) enzyme activity, which leads to elevations in several TNSALP substrates, including inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi). Elevated extracellular levels of PPi block hydroxyapatite crystal growth which inhibits bone mineralization and causes an accumulation of unmineralized bone matrix which manifests as rickets and bone deformation in infants and children and as osteomalacia (softening of bones) once growth plates close, along with muscle weakness. Replacement of the TNSALP enzyme upon Asfotase alfa treatment reduces the enzyme substrate levels.	There are no available human data on Asfotase Alfa use in pregnant women to inform a drug associated risk. In animal reproduction studies, Asfotase Alfa administered intravenously to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis showed no evidence of fetotoxicity, embryolethality or teratogenicity at doses causing plasma exposures up to 21 and 24 times, respectively, the exposure at the recommended human dose.

Asfotase Alfa is a first-in-class bone-targeted enzyme replacement therapy designed to address the underlying cause of hypophosphatasia (HPP)—deficient alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Hypophosphatasia is almost always fatal when severe skeletal disease is obvious at birth. By replacing deficient ALP, treatment with Asfotase Alfa aims to improve the elevated enzyme substrate levels and improve the body’s ability to mineralize bone, thereby preventing serious skeletal and systemic patient morbidity and premature death. Asfotase alfa was first approved by Pharmaceuticals and Medicals Devices Agency of Japan (PMDA) on July 3, 2015, then approved by the European Medicine Agency (EMA) on August 28, 2015, and was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on October 23, 2015.	Indicated for the treatment of patients with perinatal/infantile and juvenile onset hypophosphatasia (HPP).	Perinatal/infantile- and juvenile-onset HPP patients treated with Asfotase alfa had reductions in plasma TNSALP (tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase) substrates, PPi and pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) within 6 to 12 weeks of treatment. Reductions in plasma PPi and PLP levels did not correlate with clinical outcomes. Bone biopsy data from perinatal/infantile-onset and juvenile-onset HPP patients treated with Asfotase alfa demonstrated decreases in osteoid volume and thickness indicating improved bone mineralization.	HPP is caused by a deficiency in TNSALP (tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase) enzyme activity, which leads to elevations in several TNSALP substrates, including inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi). Elevated extracellular levels of PPi block hydroxyapatite crystal growth which inhibits bone mineralization and causes an accumulation of unmineralized bone matrix which manifests as rickets and bone deformation in infants and children and as osteomalacia (softening of bones) once growth plates close, along with muscle weakness. Replacement of the TNSALP enzyme upon Asfotase alfa treatment reduces the enzyme substrate levels.	There are no available human data on Asfotase Alfa use in pregnant women to inform a drug associated risk. In animal reproduction studies, Asfotase Alfa administered intravenously to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis showed no evidence of fetotoxicity, embryolethality or teratogenicity at doses causing plasma exposures up to 21 and 24 times, respectively, the exposure at the recommended human dose.

For the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who: 1) have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy; and 2) have disease progression within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy.	Atezolizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to PD-L1 and blocks its interactions with both PD-1 and B7.1 receptors. This releases the PD-L1/PD-1 mediated inhibition of the immune response, including activation of the anti-tumor immune response without inducing antibodydependent cellular cytotoxicity. In syngeneic mouse tumor models, blocking PD-L1 activity resulted in decreased tumor growth.	PD-L1 may be expressed on tumor cells and/or tumor-infiltrating immune cells and can contribute to the inhibition of the anti-tumor immune response in the tumor microenvironment.

Recombinant human C1 esterase inhibitor is a human protein developed through Pharming’s proprietary technology where the human protein is expressed in milk of transgenic rabbits. Hereditary Angioedema (HAE) is a human genetic disorder caused by a shortage of C1 inhibitor activity and results in an overreaction of the immune system. The disease is characterized by acute attacks of painful and in some cases fatal swelling of several soft tissues (edema), which may last up to five days when untreated.	For routine prophylaxis against angioedema attacks in adolescent and adult patients with Hereditary Angioedema (HAE).	In clinical studies, intravenous administration demonstrated an increase in plasma levels of C1 inhibitor within approximately one hour or less of administration.	C1 inhibitor is a normal constituent of human blood and is one of the serine proteinase inhibitors (serpins). The primary function of C1 inhibitor is to regulate the activation of the complement and intrinsic coagulation (contact system) pathway. C1 inhibitor also regulates the fibrinolytic system. Regulation of these systems is performed through the formation of complexes between the proteinases and the inhibitor, resulting in inactivation of both and consumption of the C1 inhibitor. HAE patients have low levels of endogenous or functional C1 inhibitor. Although the events that induce attacks of angioedema in HAE patients are not well defined, it is thought by some that increased vascular permeability and the clinical manifestation of HAE attacks are primarily mediated through contact system activation. Suppression of contact system activation by C1 inhibitor through the inactivation of plasma kallikrein and factor XIIa is thought to modulate this vascular permeability by preventing the generation of bradykinin1.

Immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibodies are transferred across the placenta. Due to its mechanism of action, daratumumab may cause fetal myeloid or lymphoid-cell depletion and decreased bone density. The FDA label recommends to defer administering live vaccines to neonates and infants exposed to daratumumab in utero until a hematology evaluation is completed.

It was approved by the FDA in 2014 for the treatment of Morquio syndrome. Elosulfase alfa was developed by BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. and is marketed under the brand Vimizim™. The recommended dose is 2 mg per kg given intravenously over a minimum range of 3.5 to 4.5 hours, based on infusion volume, once every week.	Vimizim is a hydrolytic lysosomal glycosaminoglycan (GAG)-specific enzyme indicated for patients with Mucopolysaccharidosis type IVA (MPS IVA; Morquio A syndrome).	AUC: 238 min x μg/mL, standard deviation 100.	Mucopolysaccharidoses comprise a group of lysosomal storage disorders caused by the deficiency of specific lysosomal enzymes required for the catabolism of glycosaminoglycans (GAG). Mucopolysaccharidosis IVA (MPS IVA, Morquio A Syndrome) is characterized by the absence or marked reduction in N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase activity.

It is a subcutaneous injection approved by the FDA for individuals on maximum statin therapy who still require additional LDL-cholesterol lowering. It is approved for both homozygous and heterozygous familial cholesterolemia as an adjunct to other first-line therapies. Evolocumab is a human IgG2 monoclonal antibody that inhibits proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9). PCSK9 is a protein that targets LDL receptors for degradation, therefore reducing the liver’s ability to remove LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), or “bad” cholesterol, from the blood. Evolocumab is designed to bind to PCSK9 and inhibit PCSK9 from binding to LDL receptors on the liver surface, resulting in more LDL receptors on the surface of the liver to remove LDL-C from the blood. Evolocumab is the second PCSK9 inhibitor on the market, first being alirocumab.	For the treatment of heterozygous/homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in patients on maximum tolerated statin therapy requiring additional LDL-cholesterol lowering.	Following single subcutaneous administration of 140 mg or 420 mg of evolocumab, maximum suppression of circulating unbound PCSK9 occurred by 4 hours. Unbound PCSK9 concentrations returned toward baseline when evolocumab concentrations decreased below the limit of quantitation.	Evolocumab is a human IgG monoclonal antibody which targets PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9). PCSK9 is a serine protease produced by the liver which binds LDL receptors and creates a complex to be targeted for lysosomal degradation. LDL receptors typically bind LDL-cholesterol (bad cholesterol) for cellular reuptake, therefore the formation of these complexes with PCSK9 inhibits LDL receptor recycling to the cell surface, resulting in decreased cellular reuptake of LDL-C and increased levels of free LDL-C in the plasma. Individuals with familial hypercholesterolemia often may have gain of function mutations in the PCSK9 molecules in their body, resulting in increased LDL-C plasma levels and a consequent cardiovascular risk. Evolocumab is able to bind both the normal PCSK9 and the gain of function mutant, D374Y. The exact mechanism of the binding has not been published, however the precursor molecule, mAb1, is indicative of the interaction. The mAb1 molecule binds on the catalytic site of PCSK9 next to the binding site for the LDL receptor and creates hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions, resulting in the steric inhibition of binding between PCSK9 and the LDL receptor. Because the formation of complexes between LDL receptor and PCSK9 are prevented, the internalized LDL receptors are less likely to be degrated by lysosomes and may recycle to the surface of the cell to serve their function of removing LDL from the blood.

Individuals with familial hypercholesterolemia often may have gain of function mutations in the PCSK9 molecules in their body, resulting in increased LDL-C plasma levels and a consequent cardiovascular risk. Evolocumab is able to bind both the normal PCSK9 and the gain of function mutant, D374Y. The exact mechanism of the binding has not been published, however the precursor molecule, mAb1, is indicative of the interaction. The mAb1 molecule binds on the catalytic site of PCSK9 next to the binding site for the LDL receptor and creates hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions, resulting in the steric inhibition of binding between PCSK9 and the LDL receptor. Because the formation of complexes between LDL receptor and PCSK9 are prevented, the internalized LDL receptors are less likely to be degrated by lysosomes and may recycle to the surface of the cell to serve their function of removing LDL from the blood.

For the treatment of acute bleeding episodes in patients with congenital fibrinogen deficiency, including afibrinogenemia and hypofibrinogenemia.	Administration of fibrinogen concentrate (human) for intravenous use to patients with congenital fibrinogen deficiency replaces the missing, or low coagulation factor. Normal levels are in the range of 200 to 450 mg/dL	Fibrinogen (factor I) is a soluble plasma glycoprotein with a molecular weight of about 340 kDa. The native molecule is a dimer and consists of three pairs of polypeptide chains (Aα, Bβ and γ). Fibrinogen is a physiological substrate of three enzymes: thrombin, factor XIIIa, and plasmin. During the coagulation process, thrombin cleaves the Aα and Bβ chains releasing fibrinopeptides A and B (FPA and FPB, respectively).2 FPA is separated rapidly and the remaining molecule is a soluble fibrin monomer (fibrin I). The slower removal of FPB results in formation of fibrin II that is capable of polymerization that occurs by aggregation of fibrin monomers.2 The resulting  fbrin is stabilized in the presence of calcium ions and by activated factor XIII, which acts as a transglutaminase. Factor XIIIa-induced cross-linking of fibrin polymers renders the fibrin clot more elastic and more resistant to fibrinolysis.3 Cross-linked  fibrin is the end result of the coagulation cascade, and provides tensile strength to a primary hemostatic platelet plug and structure to the vessel wall.

It acts to reduce blood calcium (Ca2+), opposing the effects of parathyroid hormone (PTH). It has been found in fish, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Its importance in humans has not been as well established as its importance in other animals, as its function is usually not significant in the regulation of normal calcium homeostasis. Calcitonin was extracted from the Ultimobranchial glands (thyroid-like glands) of fish, particularly salmon. Salmon calcitonin resembles human calcitonin, but is more active. At present, it is produced either by recombinant DNA technology or by chemical peptide synthesis. The pharmacological properties of the synthetic and recombinant peptides have been demonstrated to be qualitatively and quantitatively equivalent.

Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) is a mixture of IgG1 and other antibodies derived from healthy human plasma via Cohn fractionation. The purification process includes cold alcohol fractionation, polyethylene glycol precipitation, and ion exchange chromatography. IVIg contains the same distribution of IgG antibody subclasses as is found in the general human population. IgG subclasses are fully represented in the following proportions: 70.3% IgG1, 24.7% IgG2, 3.1% IgG3, and 1.9% IgG4. IVIg is used in the treatment of immunodeficiencies, as well as autoimmune and inflammatory disorders.	IVIg is used in the treatment of immunodeficiencies, as well as autoimmune and inflammatory disorders. These indications includes idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, Kawasaki disease, hypogammaglobulinemia, B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, bone marrow transplant complications, Guillain-Barré syndrome, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, myesthenia gravis, Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome and inflammatory skin diseases.	Used as a replacement therapy in inherited humoral immunodeficiency disorders such as severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome, x-linked agammaglobulinemia, and Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome. The immunoglobulins target, bind and kill bacterial cells as well as viral particles. IgG is the monomeric immunoglobulin of which there are four subclasses (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4) in differing abundances (66%, 23%, 7% and 4%). IgAs represent about 15% of the immunoglobulins in the blood. These target inhaled or ingested pathogens.	IVIg interacts with a number of different components of the immune system, including cytokines, complement, Fc receptors and several cell surface immunocompetent molecules. IVIg also impacts different effector cells of the immune system (B and T lymphocytes, dendritic cells, etc.) and regulates a wide range of genes. Its main mechanism of actions are believed to be Fc-dependent and F(ab')2-dependent. IVIg competitively blocks gamma Fc receptors, preventing the binding and ingestion of phagocytes and suppressing platelet depletion. IVIg contains a number of different antobodies, which prevent infection by attaching to the surface of invading pathogens and aiding in their disposal before they can infect cells. Antibodies remove pathogens via complement activation, agglutination or precipitation, pathogen receptor blocking, macrophage “tagging” or neutralization (via binding) of pathogen toxins. Intact IVIg and F(ab′)2 fragments of IVIg can also neutralize the activity of various autoantibodies. By triggering the production of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, IVIg modulates of the production of cytokines and cytokine antagonists.

IVIg is used in the treatment of immunodeficiencies, as well as autoimmune and inflammatory disorders. These indications includes idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, Kawasaki disease, hypogammaglobulinemia, B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, bone marrow transplant complications, Guillain-Barré syndrome, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, myesthenia gravis, Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome and inflammatory skin diseases.	Used as a replacement therapy in inherited humoral immunodeficiency disorders such as severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome, x-linked agammaglobulinemia, and Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome. The immunoglobulins target, bind and kill bacterial cells as well as viral particles. IgG is the monomeric immunoglobulin of which there are four subclasses (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4) in differing abundances (66%, 23%, 7% and 4%). IgAs represent about 15% of the immunoglobulins in the blood. These target inhaled or ingested pathogens.	IVIg interacts with a number of different components of the immune system, including cytokines, complement, Fc receptors and several cell surface immunocompetent molecules. IVIg also impacts different effector cells of the immune system (B and T lymphocytes, dendritic cells, etc.) and regulates a wide range of genes. Its main mechanism of actions are believed to be Fc-dependent and F(ab')2-dependent. IVIg competitively blocks gamma Fc receptors, preventing the binding and ingestion of phagocytes and suppressing platelet depletion. IVIg contains a number of different antobodies, which prevent infection by attaching to the surface of invading pathogens and aiding in their disposal before they can infect cells. Antibodies remove pathogens via complement activation, agglutination or precipitation, pathogen receptor blocking, macrophage “tagging” or neutralization (via binding) of pathogen toxins. Intact IVIg and F(ab′)2 fragments of IVIg can also neutralize the activity of various autoantibodies. By triggering the production of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, IVIg modulates of the production of cytokines and cytokine antagonists.

Used as a replacement therapy in inherited humoral immunodeficiency disorders such as severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome, x-linked agammaglobulinemia, and Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome. The immunoglobulins target, bind and kill bacterial cells as well as viral particles. IgG is the monomeric immunoglobulin of which there are four subclasses (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4) in differing abundances (66%, 23%, 7% and 4%). IgAs represent about 15% of the immunoglobulins in the blood. These target inhaled or ingested pathogens.	IVIg interacts with a number of different components of the immune system, including cytokines, complement, Fc receptors and several cell surface immunocompetent molecules. IVIg also impacts different effector cells of the immune system (B and T lymphocytes, dendritic cells, etc.) and regulates a wide range of genes. Its main mechanism of actions are believed to be Fc-dependent and F(ab')2-dependent. IVIg competitively blocks gamma Fc receptors, preventing the binding and ingestion of phagocytes and suppressing platelet depletion. IVIg contains a number of different antobodies, which prevent infection by attaching to the surface of invading pathogens and aiding in their disposal before they can infect cells. Antibodies remove pathogens via complement activation, agglutination or precipitation, pathogen receptor blocking, macrophage “tagging” or neutralization (via binding) of pathogen toxins. Intact IVIg and F(ab′)2 fragments of IVIg can also neutralize the activity of various autoantibodies. By triggering the production of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, IVIg modulates of the production of cytokines and cytokine antagonists. It also prevents the generation of the C5b-9 membrane attack complex and subsequent complement-mediated tissue damage by binding active complement components.

IVIg is used in the treatment of immunodeficiencies, as well as autoimmune and inflammatory disorders. These indications includes idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, Kawasaki disease, hypogammaglobulinemia, B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, bone marrow transplant complications, Guillain-Barré syndrome, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, myesthenia gravis, Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome and inflammatory skin diseases.	Used as a replacement therapy in inherited humoral immunodeficiency disorders such as severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome, x-linked agammaglobulinemia, and Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome. The immunoglobulins target, bind and kill bacterial cells as well as viral particles. IgG is the monomeric immunoglobulin of which there are four subclasses (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4) in differing abundances (66%, 23%, 7% and 4%). IgAs represent about 15% of the immunoglobulins in the blood. These target inhaled or ingested pathogens.	IVIg interacts with a number of different components of the immune system, including cytokines, complement, Fc receptors and several cell surface immunocompetent molecules. IVIg also impacts different effector cells of the immune system (B and T lymphocytes, dendritic cells, etc.) and regulates a wide range of genes. Its main mechanism of actions are believed to be Fc-dependent and F(ab')2-dependent. IVIg competitively blocks gamma Fc receptors, preventing the binding and ingestion of phagocytes and suppressing platelet depletion. IVIg contains a number of different antobodies, which prevent infection by attaching to the surface of invading pathogens and aiding in their disposal before they can infect cells. Antibodies remove pathogens via complement activation, agglutination or precipitation, pathogen receptor blocking, macrophage “tagging” or neutralization (via binding) of pathogen toxins. Intact IVIg and F(ab′)2 fragments of IVIg can also neutralize the activity of various autoantibodies. By triggering the production of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, IVIg modulates of the production of cytokines and cytokine antagonists. It also prevents the generation of the C5b-9 membrane attack complex and subsequent complement-mediated tissue damage by binding active complement components.

Vedolizumab is a recombinant humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody directed against the human lymphocyte α4β7 integrin, a key mediator of gastrointestinal inflammation. It is used in the treatment of moderate to severe active ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease for patients who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to inhibitors of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) or other conventional therapies. By blocking its primary target, α4β7 integrin, vedolizumab reduces inflammation in the gut.	It is indicated for adult patients with moderately to severely active UC or CD who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blocker or immunomodulator; or had an inadequate response with, were intolerant to, or demonstrated dependence on corticosteroids.	Non-clinical studies have shown that the pharmacodynamic effects of vedolizumab are reversible upon removal of the antibody: pharmacologic activity of cells inhibited by vedolizumab could be partially restored within 24 hours after removal, with near complete restoration within 4 days. There are no known drug interactions as vedolizumab is a humanized antibody and does not modulate production of cytokines, which is known to affect drug metabolism	Vedolizumab binds to α4β7 integrin, a key mediator of gastrointestinal inflammation expressed on the surfaces of T and B lymphocytes. By selectively inhibiting the α4β7 integrin, vedolizumab inhibits adhesion of lymphocytes to its natural ligand, mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1), thereby preventing lymphocytic cells from entering the gut lamina propria and gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). Specifically inhibiting this pathway alleviates GI inflammation without impairing systemic immune responses.	Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential, mutagenicity, or possible impairments to fertility. Elevated transaminase levels with or without elevated bilirubin has occurred in patients who have received this drug. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) has not been reported with use of this drug, however it has occurred in patients who have received different integrin receptor antagonists and is therefore considered a risk for this product. Use of vedolizumab may increase risk of developing infections, and one study found that nasopharyngitis occurs more frequently with vedolizumab than with placebo for CD patients	The expected consequence of metabolism is proteolytic degradation to small peptides and individual amino acids, and receptor-mediated clearance.	The intended route of administration is intravenous, therefore there is no absorption data and bioavailability is expected to be 100%.

Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency).	The factor VIII/von Willebrand factor complex consists of two molecules (factor VIII and von Willebrand factor) with different physiological functions. When infused into a haemophiliac patient, factor VIII binds to von Willebrand factor in the patient’s circulation. Activated factor VIII acts as a cofactor for activated factor IX, accelerating the conversion of factor X to activated factor X. Activated factor X converts prothrombin into thrombin. Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed. Haemophilia A is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased levels of factor VIII:C and results in profuse bleeding into joints, muscles or internal organs, either spontaneously or as results of accidental or surgical trauma. By replacement therapy the plasma levels of factor VIII are increased, thereby temporarily enabling a correction of the factor VIII deficiency and correction of the bleeding tendencies.

Siltuximab is a chimeric (human-mouse) monoclonal immunoglobulin G1-kappa antibody produced in a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line by recombinant DNA technology. Siltuximab prevents the binding of IL-6 to soluble and membrane-bound IL-6 receptors by forming high affinity complexes with human interleukin-6 (IL-6). Its use is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with multicentric Castleman’s disease (MCD) who are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) negative and human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) negative. MCD is a rare blood disorder caused by dysregulated IL-6 production, proliferation of lymphocytes, and subsequent enlargement of the lymph nodes. It is administered as a 1 hour intravenous infusion every 3 weeks.	It is indicated for the treatment of patients with multicentric Castleman's disease (MCD) who are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) negative and human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) negative. Siltuximab did not bind to virally produced IL-6 in a nonclinical study and was therefore not studied in patients with MCD who are HIV or HHV-8 positive.	Siltuximab-neutralized antibody-IL-6 complexes interfere with current immunological-based IL-6 quantification methods, therefore measurement of serum or plasma IL-6 concentrations should not be used as a pharmacodynamic marker during treatment. As well, cytochrome P450 enzymes in the liver are down regulated by infection and inflammation stimuli, which includes cytokines such as IL-6. By preventing IL-6 signalling through treatment with siltuximab, CYP450 activity may be increased leading to faster metabolism of drugs that are CYP450 substrates.	Siltuximab complexes with human IL-6 and prevents binding to soluble and membrane-bound IL-6 receptors, thereby inhibiting the proliferation of lymphocytes.	The most common side effects that occurred during siltuximab treatment were pruritis, increased weight, rash, hyperuricemia, and upper respiratory tract infection. Siltuximab should not be administered to patients with severe infections as it may mask signs and symptoms of acute inflammation including suppression of fever and acute phase reactants such as C-reactive protein (CRP). Gastrointestinal perforation has been reported in clinical trials, therefore use with caution in patients who may be at increased risk for GI perforation.	As siltuximab is an antibody, the expected consequence of metabolism is proteolytic degradation to small peptides and individual amino acids, and receptor-mediated clearance.

The amino acid sequence for sebelipase alfa is the same as the amino acid sequence for human LAL. Sebelipase alfa is an orphan drug which is expected to cost about $310,000 for annual treatment in the United States. Sebelipase alfa is marketed under the brand name Kanuma™ by Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.	Sebelipase alfa is a hydrolytic lysosomal cholesteryl ester and triacylglycerol-specific enzyme indicated for the treatment of patients with a diagnosis of Lysosomal Acid Lipase (LAL) deficiency.	In clinical trials, after initiation of dosing with KANUMA, breakdown of accumulated lysosomal lipid led to initial increases in LDL-c and triglycerides within the first 2 to 4 weeks of treatment. In general, following increases in LDL-c and triglycerides, these parameters decreased to below pre-treatment values within 8 weeks of treatment with KANUMA.	LAL deficiency is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder characterized by a genetic defect resulting in a marked decrease or loss in activity of the lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) enzyme. The primary site of action of the LAL enzyme is the lysosome, where the enzyme normally causes the breakdown of lipid particles including LDL-c. Deficient LAL enzyme activity results in progressive complications due to the lysosomal accumulation of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides in multiple organs, including the liver, spleen, intestine, and the walls of blood vessels. The resulting lipid accumulation in the liver may lead to increased liver fat content and progression of liver disease, including fibrosis and cirrhosis. Lipid accumulation in the intestinal wall leads to malabsorption and growth failure. In parallel, dyslipidemia due to impaired degradation of lysosomal lipid is common with elevated LDL-c and triglycerides and low HDL-cholesterol (HDL-c). Sebelipase alfa binds to cell surface receptors via glycans expressed on the protein and is subsequently internalized into lysosomes. Sebelipase alfa catalyzes the lysosomal hydrolysis of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides to free cholesterol, glycerol and free fatty acids.

People with CSID have variable amounts of sucrose-isomaltase enzyme activity and therefore have issues metabolizing dietary disaccharide sucrose causing chronic or intermittent watery diarrhea in infants and children. Treatment options for these patients are limited and usually consists of a lifelong sucrose-free diet; therefore, sacrosidase offers a potential alternative for symptom relief.	For the treatment of congenital sucrose-isomaltase deficiency (CSID).	Sucrase is naturally produced in the brush border of the small intestine, primarily the distal duodenum and jejunum.

In contrast to other agents directed against VEGFR-2, ramucirumab binds a specific epitope on the extracellular domain of VEGFR-2, thereby blocking all VEGF ligands from binding to it. Ramucirumab is indicated for us in advanced gastric or gastro-esophageal junction adenocarcinoma as a single agent or in combination with paclitaxel after prior fluoropyrimidine- or platinum-containing chemotherapy.

1810	Th1201	Poractant alfa	NA	Ia	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	Studied in adult and newborn rabbits, the half-life in the lungs was found to be 25 and 67 respectively.	Poractant alfa is a pulmonary surfactant marketed as Curosurf in the United States and Canada. It is used to treat Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS) in premature infants with an endogenous pulmonary surfactant deficiency. Poractant alfa is an extract of natural porcine lung surfactant consisting of 99% polar lipids (mainly phospholipids) and 1% hydrophobic low molecular weight proteins (surfactant associated proteins SP-B and SP-C). The phospholipid content of the extract consists primarily of phosphatidylcholine and dipaImitoylphosphatidylcholine. Poractant alfa is a creamy white suspension of this extract in 0.9% sodium chloride solution. It contains no preservatives.	Poractant alfa is indicated for the treatment of Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS) in premature infants.	Poractant alfa improved lung compliance, pulmonary gas exchange and survival in preterm rabbits.	Endogenous pulmonary surfactant reduces surface tension at the air-liquid interface of the alveoli in the lungs, thus stabilizing them against collapse under transpulmonary pressures. A deficiency of pulmonary surfactant in premature infants allows surface tension to increase to the point where sections of lung collapse and respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) develops. Poractant alfa lowers minimum surface tension to less than or equal to 4 mN/m. This compensates for the lack of endogenous surfactant and restores adequate surface activity to the lungs	Studies on the carcinogenicity or reproductive effects of poractant alfa have not been conducted. Mutagenicity assays were negative. In the case of an overdose with poractant alfa where there are clear clinical effects on the infant's respiration, ventilation, or oxygenation, it is recommended that as much of the solution be aspirated as possible and the infant be managed with supportive measures. Fluid and electrolyte balances should be monitored closely in this case.	No studies on the metabolism of poractant alfa have been performed in humans. One small study in rabbits did find that poractant alfa may be degraded by macrophages and that it may, in part, be recycled in the alveoli in a similar manner to endogenous lung surfactant.	Poractant alfa is administered directly to the site of action in the lungs via endotracheal tube. It very rapidly adsorbs to the air-liquid interface to form a stable surfactant monolayer. No studies on absorption of poractant alfa have been performed in humans.	No studies on the distribution of poractant alfa have been performed in humans.	No studies on clearance of poractant alfa have been performed in humans.

Pembrolizumab is an antibody drug that targets the cell surface receptor programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) found on T cells. By preventing the binding of its ligands (PD-L1 and PD-L2), pembrolizumab induces an antitumor immune response. Upregulation of PD-1 ligands occurs in some tumors and signaling through this pathway can contribute to inhibition of active T-cell immune surveillance of tumors. Its use is indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma and disease progression following therapy with ipilimumab and, if BRAF V600 mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor. Due to its success in clinical trials, pembrolizumab was approved early to allow quick patient access and was given breakthrough therapy and orphan drug designation. Pembrolizumab (as Keytruda) was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat advanced cases of the most common type of lung malignancy, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) on Oct. 2, 2015.	For the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma and disease progression following therapy with ipilimumab and, if BRAF V600 mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor. It is also for the treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC (non-small cell lung cancer) whose tumors express PD-L1 (as determined by an approved test) and who have disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy.	In syngeneic mouse tumor models, blocking PD-1 activity resulted in decreased tumor growth.	Pembrolizumab is an antibody drug that targets the cell surface receptor programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) found on T cells. By preventing the binding of its ligands (PD-L1 and PD-L2), pembrolizumab induces an antitumor immune response. Upregulation of PD-1 ligands is a mechanism for tumours to evade antitumor immune response; when PD-1 binds its ligand, the T cell receives an inhibitory signal leading to T cell anergy and blockade of anti tumour immune response. Instead of directly targeting tumor tissue to induce tumor cell death, pembrolizumab acts as a checkpoint inhibitor to stimulate immune responses to eliminate cancer cells.	Since therapy with pembrolizumab induces tumour regression by stimulation of immune responses, side effects may be caused by activating potentially self-reactive T cells. This includes immune-mediated pneumonitis, colitis, hypophysitis, nephritis and renal failure, hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, and hepatitis. Other adverse events such as myasthenic syndrome, optic neuritis, uveitis, arthritis, pancreatitis, partial seizures, and rhabdomnyolysis were reported to occur in less than 1% of patients during clinical trials.

Nivolumab is indicated for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma for patients who no longer respond to treatment with other drugs. It is intended for use in patients who have been previously treated with ipilimumab and is used for melanoma patients after treatment with ipilimumab and a BRAF inhibitor in patients whose tumors express BRAF V600 gene mutations. Historically there have been very few effective treatments for advanced melanoma, which is why this product was approved under an FDA accelerated program to allow earlier patient access.	Combined nivolumab (anti-PD-1) and ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4) mediated inhibition results in enhanced T-cell function that is greater than the effects of either antibody alone, and results in improved anti-tumor responses in metastatic melanoma. In murine syngeneic tumor models, dual blockade of PD-1 and CTLA-4 resulted in increased anti-tumor activity.	Nivolumab is a human immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody that binds to the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) receptor and selectively blocks interaction with its programmed death ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2. Upregulation of PD-1 ligands occurs in some tumors and signalling through this pathway can contribute to inhibition of active T-cell immune surveillance of tumour tissue. The inhibitory effect of PD-1 and its ligands occurs through the promotion of apoptosis in antigen specific T cells while simultaneously blocking apoptosis in suppressor T cells. Blocking PD-1 activity has been shown to lead to decreased tumour growth in mouse tumour models.	Based on data from animal studies, there is risk of fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. It is therefore advisable for pregnant women to use contraception during treatment and for 5 months afterwards. There have been reported cases of severe pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease, including fatal cases, with the use of nivolumab during clinical trials. Therefore, patients taking this drug should be monitored for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. During clinical trials there have also been reports of the development of immune-mediated colitis, immune-mediated hepatitis with increased liver test abnormalities, immune-mediated nephritis and renal dysfunction, immune-mediated hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, and rare cases of other immune-mediated reactions such as pancreatitis, uveitis, demyelination, autoimmune neuropathy, adrenal insufficiency, and facial and abducens nerve paresis.	As nivolumab is an antibody, the expected consequence of metabolism is proteolytic degradation to small peptides and individual amino acids, and receptor-mediated clearance.	The intended route of administration is intravenous, therefore bioavailability is expected to be 100%.	8.0 L	9.5 mL/hr	Antineoplastic and Immunomodulating Agents	US2013173223 	41407	48712	Belimumab	Programmed cell death protein 1	Opdivo	E.R.

It functions by binding to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and prevents binding of its ligands, a process that is involved in cell proliferation, metastasis, angiogenesis, and malignant progression. Binding of necitumumab to EGFR induces receptor internalization and degradation, thereby preventing further activation of EGFR which is beneficial in NSCLC as many patients have increased protein expression of EGFR. Necitumumab is approved for use in combination with cisplatin and gemcitabine as a first-line treatment for metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Affecting less than 500 people worldwide, lipodystrophy is characterized by a lack of adipose tissue, fat deposition in the muscles and liver, and metabolic complications such as hypertriglyceridemia, insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus, and fatty liver disease. These metabolic abnormalities are often aggravated by excessive food intake, which is further aggravated by leptin deficiency, a protein secreted by adipose tissue. Administration of Metreleptin results in improvement of metabolic symptoms including improvements in insulin resistance, reduced HbA1c and fasting glucose, reduced triglycerides, and reductions in food intake. Metreleptin is produced in E. coli and differs from native human leptin by the addition of a methionine residue at its amino terminus. It is administered as a once daily subcutaneous injection. On Feb. 24, 2014, Metreleptin was approved by the FDA for the treatment of complications of leptin deficiency, in addition to diet, in patients with congenital generalized or acquired generalized lipodystrophy. Metreleptin is marketed under the brand Myalept® by Aegerion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.	It is indicated as an adjunct to diet as replacement therapy to treat the complications of leptin deficiency in patients with congenital or acquired generalized lipodystrophy.	In patients with leptin deficiency, clinical trials demonstrated that exogenous leptin administration results in weight loss, reduction in mean HbA1c and fasting glucose levels, reduced blood insulin, and reduced triglyceride levels leading to improved insulin sensitivity and reductions in food intake.	Metreleptin functions by binding to and activating the human leptin receptor (ObR), which belongs to the Class I cytokine family of receptors that signals through the JAK/STAT transduction pathway.	The most common adverse events reported for metreleptin use have been headache, hypoglycemia, weight loss, and abdominal pain. A boxed warning states that anti-metreleptin antibodies, serious infections, and worsening metabolic control have been reported in patients taking the drug, and that some patients with acquired generalized lipodystrophy taking metreleptin have developed T-cell lymphoma. Anti-metreleptin antibodies with neutralizing activity have been identified in patients treated with metreleptin which can lead to inhibition of endogenous leptin action and loss of drug efficacy. As part of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS), the FDA has required healthcare providers to be trained in the use of metreleptin before prescribing it and to attest that patients for whom they prescribe metreleptin have a labeled indication for the drug. Metreleptin is classified as category C (no adequate studies in women) for use during pregnancy. Two-year carcinogenicity studies in rodents have not been conducted with metreleptin. No proliferative or preneoplastic lesions were observed in mice or dogs following treatment up to six months. However, leptin is reported in the literature to promote cell proliferation in vitro and tumor progression in some mouse models of cancer. Metreleptin was not mutagenic in the Ames bacterial mutagenicity assay or clastogenic in an in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster ovary cells and human peripheral blood lymphocytes. Metreleptin was not mutagenic or clastogenic in an in vivo mouse micronucleus assay. In a fertility study in mice, metreleptin had no adverse effects on mating, fertility, or early embryonic development at doses ranging between 7 and 15 times the maximum recommended clinical dose based on body surface area of a 20- and 60-kg patient, respectively.	No formal metabolism studies have been conducted with metreleptin. Nonclinical data indicate renal clearance is the major route of metreleptin elimination, with no apparent contribution of systemic metabolism or degradation.	Peak serum leptin concentration (Cmax) occurred approximately 4.0 to 4.3 hours after subcutaneous administration of single doses ranging from 0.1 to 0.3 mg/kg in healthy subjects.	Following intravenous administration of metreleptin, leptin volume of distribution was approximately 4 to 5 times plasma volume; volumes (mean ± SD) were 370 ± 184 mL/kg, 398 ± 92 mL/kg, and 463 ± 116 mL/kg for 0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 mg/kg/day doses, respectively.	The clearance of metreleptin is expected to be delayed in the presence of leptin antibodies.

It has a molecular weight of approximately 149 kDa. It was approved by the FDA in November, 2015 for the treatment of asthma under the brand name Nucala (marketed by GlaxoSmithKline). Mepolizumab has been investigated in the treatment of severe nasal polyposis, among numerous other conditions.	Mepolizumab is indicated for add-on maintenance treatment of severe eosinophilic asthma, as identified by blood eosinophils greater than or equal to 150 cells/μl at initiation of treatment or blood eosinophils greater than or equal to 300 cells/μl in the past 12 months, in patients aged 12 years and older. Mepolizumab has been shown to reduce exacerbations of asthma in patients with an exacerbation history	The pharmacodynamic response (blood eosinophil reduction) following repeat doses of mepolizumab administered subcutaneously or intravenously was evaluated in subjects with asthma and blood eosinophil levels greater than 200 cells/mcL. Subjects received 1 of 4 mepolizumab treatments (administered every 28 days for a total of 3 doses): 12.5 mg SC, 125 mg SC, 250 mg SC, or 75 mg IV. Sixty-six (66) of the 70 randomized subjects completed the trial. Compared with baseline levels, blood eosinophils decreased in a dose-dependent manner. A reduction in blood eosinophil levels was observed in all treatment groups by Day 3. On Day 84 (4 weeks post-last dose), the observed geometric mean reduction from baseline in blood eosinophils was 64%, 78%, 84%, and 90% in the 12.5-mg SC, 75-mg IV, 125-mg SC, and 250-mg SC treatment groups, respectively. The model-predicted SC doses providing 50% and 90% of maximal reduction of blood eosinophils at Day 84 were estimated to be 11 and 99 mg, respectively. These results, along with the clinical efficacy data from the dose-ranging exacerbation trial (Trial 1) supported the evaluation of mepolizumab 75 mg IV and 100 mg SC in the confirmatory trials [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Following SC administration of mepolizumab 100 mg every 4 weeks for 32 weeks (Trial 2), blood eosinophils were reduced to a geometric mean count of 40 cells/mcL, which corresponds to a geometric mean reduction of 84% compared with placebo. This magnitude of reduction was observed within 4 weeks of treatment and was maintained throughout the treatment period	Mepolizumab is an interleukin-5 antagonist (IgG1 kappa). IL-5 is the major cytokine responsible for the growth and differentiation, recruitment, activation, and survival of eosinophils. Mepolizumab binds to IL-5 with a dissociation constant of 100 pM, inhibiting the bioactivity of IL-5 by blocking its binding to the alpha chain of the IL-5 receptor complex expressed on the eosinophil cell surface. Inflammation is an important component in the pathogenesis of asthma. Multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, cytokines) are involved in inflammation. Mepolizumab, by inhibiting IL-5 signaling, reduces the production and survival of eosinophils; however, the mechanism of mepolizumab action in asthma has not been definitively established.		Mepolizumab is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that is degraded by proteolytic enzymes widely distributed in the body and not restricted to hepatic tissue.	Following 100-mg SC administration in the upper arm of subjects with asthma, the bioavailability of mepolizumab was estimated to be approximately 80%. Following repeat SC administration once every 4 weeks, there was approximately a 2-fold accumulation at steady state.	The population central volume of distribution of mepolizumab in patients with asthma is estimated to be 3.6 L for a 70-kg individual.	The population apparent systemic clearance of mepolizumab in patients with asthma is estimated to be 0.28 L/day for a 70-kg individual.

Composed of alpha and beta chains, processed from pro-insulin. Forms a hexameric structure.	For the treatment of type I and II diabetes mellitus.	Insulin is used in the treatment of type I and type II diabetes. The primary activity of insulin is the regulation of glucose metabolism. In muscle and other tissues (except the brain), insulin causes rapid transport of glucose and amino acids intracellularly. It also promotes anabolism, and inhibits protein catabolism. In the liver, insulin promotes the uptake and storage of glucose in the form of glycogen, inhibits gluconeogenesis, and promotes the conversion of excess glucose into fat.	Insulin binds to the insulin receptor (IR), a heterotetrameric protein consisting of two extracellular alpha units and two transmembrane beta units. The binding of insulin to the alpha subunit of IR stimulates the tyrosine kinase activity intrinsic to the beta subunit of the receptor. The bound receptor is able to autophosphorylate and phosphorylate numerous intracellular substrates such as insulin receptor substrates (IRS) proteins, Cbl, APS, Shc and Gab 1. These activated proteins, in turn, lead to the activation of downstream signaling molecules including PI3 kinase and Akt. Akt regulates the activity of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and protein kinase C (PKC) which play a critical role in metabolism.

Indicated to improve glycemic control in adults with diabetes mellitus.	The glucose-lowering effect of TRESIBA after 8 days of once-daily dosing was measured in a euglycemic glucose clamp study enrolling 21 patients with type 1 diabetes. Figure 2 shows the pharmacodynamic effect of TRESIBA over time following 8 once-daily subcutaneous injections of 0.4 U/kg of TRESIBA in patients with type 1 diabetes.	The primary activity of insulin, including TRESIBA, is regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulin and its analogs lower blood glucose by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake, especially by skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Insulin also inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis, and enhances protein synthesis. TRESIBA forms multi-hexamers when injected into the subcutaneous tissue resulting in a subcutanous insulin degludec depot. The protracted time action profile of TRESIBA is predominantly due to delayed absorption of insulin degludec from the subcutaneous tissue to the systemic circulation and to a lesser extent due to binding of insulin-degludec to circulating albumin.	NA	The affinity of insulin degludec to serum albumin corresponds to a plasma protein binding of > 99% in human plasma.

Composed of alpha and beta chains, processed from pro-insulin. Forms a hexameric structure.	For the treatment of type I and II diabetes mellitus.	Insulin is used in the treatment of type I and type II diabetes. The primary activity of insulin is the regulation of glucose metabolism. In muscle and other tissues (except the brain), insulin causes rapid transport of glucose and amino acids intracellularly. It also promotes anabolism, and inhibits protein catabolism. In the liver, insulin promotes the uptake and storage of glucose in the form of glycogen, inhibits gluconeogenesis, and promotes the conversion of excess glucose into fat.	Insulin binds to the insulin receptor (IR), a heterotetrameric protein consisting of two extracellular alpha units and two transmembrane beta units. The binding of insulin to the alpha subunit of IR stimulates the tyrosine kinase activity intrinsic to the beta subunit of the receptor. The bound receptor is able to autophosphorylate and phosphorylate numerous intracellular substrates such as insulin receptor substrates (IRS) proteins, Cbl, APS, Shc and Gab 1. These activated proteins, in turn, lead to the activation of downstream signaling molecules including PI3 kinase and Akt. Akt regulates the activity of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and protein kinase C (PKC) which play a critical role in metabolism.

The primary function of endogenous C1INH is to regulate the activation of the complement and contact system pathways. It does this through inhibition of several target proteases within these pathways including activated C1s, kallikrein, factor XIIa and factor XIa. C1 esterase inhibitor has also been shown to inhibit the action of thrombin within the coagulation pathway, and tPA and plasmin within the fibrinolytic pathway. Deficiency of C1-inhibitor permits plasma kallikrein activation, which leads to the production of the vasoactive peptide bradykinin. Additionally, C4 and C2 cleavage goes unchecked, resulting in auto-activation of the complement system. Down-stream effects of the lack of enzyme inhibition by C1 esterase inhibitor results in swelling due to leakage of fluid from blood vessels into connective tissue and consequently the presentation of hereditary angioedema (HAE). Marketed as the product Ruconest (FDA), this drug is indicated for the treatment of acute attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE) due to C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency in adults. Intravenous replacement of C1 esterase inhibitor results in reversal of acute symptoms of HAE.

It is expressed in a murine Sp2/0-Ag14 cell line and comprised of two 447- (or 448-) residue heavy chains and two 214-residue light chains, with a molecular mass of 145157 Daltons when deglycosylated. Both heavy chains of canakinumab contain oligosaccharide chains linked to the protein backbone at asparagine 298 (Asn 298). Canakinumab binds to human IL-1β and neutralizes its inflammatory activity by blocking its interaction with IL-1 receptors, but it does not bind IL-1alpha or IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra). Canakinumab is marketed under the brand name Ilaris and indicated for patients 4 years of age and older to treat Familial Cold Autoinflammatory Syndrome (FCAS) and Muckle-Wells Syndrome (MWS), which are both part of the Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS) as well as for patients 2 years of age and older to treat systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA). Clinical trials have established the administration of canakinumab every 2 weeks to be safe and effective, offering a considerable advantage over the existing treatment with the human IL-1 receptor antagonist, anakinra, which must be injected daily and which is often poorly tolerated by patients.	Used in patients 4 years of age and older to treat Familial Cold Autoinflammatory Syndrome (FCAS) and Muckle-Wells Syndrome (MWS), which are both part of the Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS) as well as for patients 2 years of age and older to treat systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA).	Novartis AG has developed canakinumab as a subcutaneous injection and fully human mAb that neutralizes the bioactivity of human IL-1beta, which is involved in several inflammatory disorders. Canakinumab has promising clinical safety and pharmacokinetic properties, and demonstrated potential for the treatment of cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS), systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA), and possibly for other complex inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, COPD disease and ocular diseases.	In inflammatory diseases involving Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) is excessively activated and drives inflammation. The protein cryopyrin controls the activation of IL-1β, and mutations in cryopyrin's gene, NLRP-3, up-regulate IL-1β activation.

Current strategies for treatment include immunotherapy with drugs such as dinutuximab to target surviving neuroblastoma cells and to prevent relapse.	In vitro dinutuximab binds to neuroblastoma tumour cells and mediates the lysis of tumour cells via cell-mediated and complement-mediated cytotoxicity.

By binding to GD2, dinutiximab induces antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity of tumor cells thereby leading to apoptosis and inhibiting proliferation of the tumour.	The most common (incidence 15 %) grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events in dinutuximab compared with standard therapy recipients were neuropathic pain (52 vs. 6 %), fever without neutropenia (39 vs. 6 %), any in-fection (39 vs. 22 %), hypokalaemia (35 vs. 2 %), hypersensitivity reactions (25 vs. 1 %), hyponatraemia (23 vs. 4 %), elevation of alanine transferase levels (23 vs. 3 %) and hypotension (18 vs. 0 %). Based on its mechanism of action, dinutuximab may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman however, there are no studies in pregnant women and no reproductive studies in animals to inform the drug-associated risk. Non-clinical studies suggest that dinutuximab-induced neuropathic pain is mediated by binding of the antibody to the GD2 antigen located on the surface of peripheral nerve fibers and myelin and subsequent induction of cell- and complement-mediated cytotoxicity. In clinical trials, 114 (85%) patients treated in the dinutuximab/RA group experienced pain despite pre­-treatment with analgesics including morphine sulfate infusion. Severe (Grade 3) pain occurred in 68 (51%) patients in the dinutuximab/RA group compared to 5 (5%) patients in the RA group. Pain typically occurred during the dinutuximab infusion and was most commonly reported as abdominal pain, generalized pain, extremity pain, back pain, neuralgia, musculoskeletal chest pain, and arthralgia.

Lenograstim is a recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor which functions as an immunostimulator.	The drug is used to reduce the risk of life-threatening infection in patients with neutropenia, particularly after cytotoxic chemotherapy. GRANOCYTE ( Lenograstim) is indicated as a treatment to reduce the duration of neutropenia and the severity of infections in patients with non-myeloid malignancy who have undergone autologous or allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, or treatment with established cytotoxic chemotherapy and in addition to reduce the incidence of infection associated with established cytotoxic chemotherapy. GRANOCYTE is also indicated to mobilise peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPCs) with GRANOCYTE alone, or after myelosuppressive chemotherapy, in order to accelerate haematopoietic recovery by infusion of such cells, after myelosuppressive or myeloablative therapy. GRANOCYTE is also indicated to accelerate the engraftment of these cells after their reinfusion. GRANOCYTE is also indicated for the treatment of severe chronic neutropenia including congenital agranulocytosis (Kostmann's syndrome).	Lenograstim has been confirmed as a valuable adjunct to minimise the haematological toxicity of myelosuppressive chemotherapy in patients with malignant disease. The drug also enhances neutrophil recovery in patients undergoing stem cell rescue, and assists PBSC mobilisation.	Lenograstim is the glycosylated recombinant form of human granulocyte colony stimulating factor. Lenograstim accelerates neutrophil recovery significantly after chemotherapy, with beneficial effects on clinical end-points such as incidence of laboratory-confirmed infection and length of hospital stay. Chemotherapy dose intensity has also been increased in patients receiving lenograstim, notably those with breast or small cell lung cancer, although improvements in tumour response and survival have not been demonstrated. Lenograstim also assists neutrophil recovery in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation, and stimulates the production of peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) for autologous transfusion after aggressive chemotherapy.

Similarly to rasburicase, pegloticase metabolises the conversion of uric acid to allantoin. This reduces the risk of precipitate formation and development of gout, since allantoin is five to ten times more soluble than uric acid. In contrast to rasburicase, pegloticase is pegylated to increase its elimination half-life from about eight hours to ten or twelve days, and to decrease the immunogenicity of the foreign uricase protein. This modification allows for an application just once every two to four weeks, making this drug suitable for long-term treatment.

Protamine sulfate is a drug that reverses the anticoagulant effects of heparin by binding to it. It was originally isolated from the sperm of salmon and other species of fish but is now produced primarily through recombinant biotechnology. Protamine sulfate was approved for medical use in the United States in 1969. Protamine sulfate (protamine (protamines) s) occurs as fine white or off-white amorphous or crystalline powder. It is sparingly soluble in water. The pH is between 6 and 7. The cationic hydrogenated protamine at a pH of 6.8 to 7.1 reacts with anionic heparin at a pH of 5.0 to 7.5 to form an inactive complex.	Protamine sulfate is usually administered to reverse the large dose of heparin administered during certain surgeries, especially heart surgery.	Protamine sulphate 1% demonstrates activity neutralising anticoagulant properties of heparin, creating the complex heparin/protamine. Activity of protamine (towards heparin) takes place within five minutes after intravenous injection of the preparation.	It is a highly cationic peptide that binds to either heparin or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) to form a stable ion pair, which does not have anticoagulant activity. The ionic complex is then removed and broken down by the reticuloendothelial system. In large doses, protamine sulfate may also have an independent—however weak—anticoagulant effect.	Administration of protamine sulfate intravenously could result in severe drop in blood pressure, dyspnea, bradycardia, pulmonary hypertension and anaphylaxis. Systemic hypertension, nausea, vomiting and lassitude were also reported. Overdosage of this drug may theoretically result in hemorrhage.	Metabolic fate of the protamine-heparin complex has not been elucidated; however, protamine-heparin complex may be partially metabolized or attacked by fibrinolysin, freeing heparin.	After IV adminsteration, protamine sulfate takes less than 5 min. to neutralize heparin.	12.3 L	Clearance is: 2.2 L/min	Heparin Antagonists, Hematologic Agents	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	Protamine Sulfate Injection, USP	Omega Laboratories Ltd	Protamine Sulfate Injection, USP is a sterile, non-pyrogenic, isotonic solution of protamine sulfate in Water for Injection.
