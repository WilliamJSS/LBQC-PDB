Derivatives: Api88 (sequence: gu-ONNRPVYIPRPRPPHPRL-NH2, gu=N,N,N',N'-tetramethylguanidino) is an optimized analogue of apidaecin 1b with improved antibacterial activities. Api137 has an amino acid sequence (Gu-ONNRPVYIPRPRPPHPRL-OH) similar to Api88.
MOA: Api88 and Api137 interact with the 50S subunit of the 70S ribosome of bacteria. It can block the release of release factors from ribosomes. APi137 is the first such inhibitor identifed to date (Florin T et al., 2017).
Recombinant production:bacteria:Streptomyces lividans: Apidaecin was expressed as a fusion protein with Streptomyces subtilisin inhibitor (SSI) gene. Antibacterial activity against E. coli can be detected before and after cleavage with factor Xa (enzyme cleavage).
Animal model:mouse: It displayed high efficacy in systemic E. coli and K. pneumoniae septicemia infection mouse models (Ostorhazi E et al., 2014). Apiaecin Api137 shows a dose-dependent protection of the CD-1 mice (67% survival over 5 days) from E. coli ATCC 25922 infection caused death when treated subcutaneously (continuous SC fusion) but not intravenously (Knappe et al, Front.

A S-S bond led to a CYCLIC DODECAPEPTIDE, which is more active against gram- bacteria.
Derivative: Only linearized versions of the peptides (Bac2A, obtained by converting the two Cys residues to Ala residues, plus C-terminal amidation) showed activtiy against Gram+ bacteria such as S. epidermidis and E. facaelis. The linearized or reduced forms appeared to be more effective in dissipating the membrane potential (Wu M and Hancock,RE 1999 JBC 274: 29-35).
MOA: Like NaD1, Bac2A is unable to disrupt SUVs and interacts with intracellular targets yet to be identified (van der Weerden et al. 2010 JBC 285:37513-20).
Synergy: This peptide displayed synergistic effects with indolicidin (entry 150) against E. coli (Yan H & Hancock REW 2001 Antimicrob Agents Chemother 45: 1558-60).

SAR: Fragments of Bac5 was generated to identify the minimal sequence required to inhibit bacterial protein synthesis. Deletion of amino acids from the C-terminus reduces peptide activity. Bac5(1-17) is the smallest active peptide, while bac5(1-25) is most active. The N-terminus is critical for peptide ativity (Mardirossian M et al., 2019).

Sequence analysis: Rich in P (46.7%) and R (28.3%).
SAR: Bac7(1-35) has antibacterial activity similar to bac7. Also, Bac7(1–16) was an equally potent inhibitor as Bac7(1–35), consistent with the similar MICs observed for these two derivatives. However, the N-terminal arginine pair is needed for efficient uptake (Guida et al., 2015).
MOA: At ~MIC, the fragment binds to internal targets via stereospecific uptake (because all-D-enantiomer failed to be taken in and much less active L>D); at higher concentrations, it works via non-specific membranolytic mechanism. Bac(1-16) is still active against E. coli and S. enterica but kinetically deficient compared to bac(1-35). Bac(5-35) is much less active, indicating the importance of the N-terminal segment (Biochim Biophys Acta 2006; 1760: 1732-1740).
Structure: Crystal structures of Bac 7 fragments in complex with E. coli Dnak have been solved [PDB ID 4JWC (use the PDB link below) for Bac7(1-16) and 4JWD for Bac7(15-28 )]. However, Bac7(1-35) is likely to bind to the 70S ribosome and inhibit protein synthesis Mario Mardirossian et al, 2014online. You can rotate, zoom, and view the structure of Bac7(1-35) in complex with the T. thermophilus 70S ribosome here in the PDB. By removing the first 4 critical residues, peptide Bac7(5-35) can only stabilize the initiation complex at a high concentration of 100 uM, providing a structural basis to the significance of the N-terminal segment (Seefeldt AC et al., 2016).

Structure of LfcinB6 was determined in SDS micelles (Vogel HJ et al 2002 Biochem Cell Biol 80:49-63). Free LfcinB6 did not kill T-leukemia or breast cancer cells, but LfcinB6 was strongly cytotoxic when delivered to the cytosolic compartment by fusogenic liposomes (Richardson A 2009 Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2009 Aug 21).

SAR: Residue 1-18 appears to contain the antimicrobial region that forms predominantly a helical conformation in TFE (Biopolymers2012). An amphibian antimicrobial peptide variant expressed in Nicotiana tabacum confers resistance to bacterial or fungal phytopathogens. Also showed insecticidal effect.
Transgenic plants: A M28L mutant was expressed in plants. The morphology of transgenic plants was unaffected. Challenging these plants with bacterial or fungal phytopathogens demonstrated enhanced resistance up to the second generation.

SAR: Disulfide-bridge formation Between C11 and C18 is indispensable for antimicrobial activity and is closely related to the activity specificity towards bacteria (Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2008 May 2;369(2):609-15). The S-S bond is also important for salt tolerance and for pore formation in membranes. C-terminal amidation had little effect. However, P. aeruginosa is 8-fold more sentive to the C-terminally amidated form. Antimicrobial activity decreases with the removel of more and more N-terminal residues (3 to 9). An all-D-enantiomer is almost inactive against Gram- bacteria but is fully active against fungi and some Gram+ bacteria, suggesting microbe-dependent mechanisms of action.
Toxicity: porcine erythrocytes: Thanatin is not hemo-lytic at 40 uM.
Structure: A hairpin-like structure was found in solution (Mandard et al 1998 Eur J Biochem 256: 404). You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structure here in the PDB. A T15S mutant (S-thanatin) binds LPS.
MOA: in 2019, it is found that thanatin can compete for LPS with divalent cations such as Ca2+ and Mg2+, which are essential for membrane integrity. It also binds to the NDM-1 mettllo-beta-lactamase to replace Zn2+, inhibiting the hydrolase activity of this pathogen enzyme. This peptide also sensitizes the activity of antibiotics (Ma B et al., 2019). Trangenic plants: the thanatin transformant acquired a sufficient level of resistance to the rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae, presumably due to the repressive activity of thanatin to its initial stage of infection (Imamura T et al. 2010 Transgenic Res. 19:415-24). Recombinant thanatin is also active against Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV) (Sabokkhiz MA et al. 2019).

Warning: this structure may not represent the membrane-bound form. A P14A mutation removed the bend but became 2.5-fold more hemolytic. MOA:fungi: Melittin hinders fungal growth (numerous strains, see the ref) by several mechanisms such as membrane permeabilization, apoptosis induction by reactive oxygen species-mediated mitochondria/caspase-dependent pathway, inhibition of (1,3)-beta-D-glucan synthase, and alterations in fungal gene expression (Memariani and Memariani, 2020).
MOA:virus: It inhibits HIV by suppressing viral gene expression (J Gen Virol 1998; 79:731-40). Found in multiple species.
Toxicity: It is highly hemolytic (100% at 6.25 uM) and can cause histamine releasing (85% at 10 uM) (Kawakami et al., 2017).

Chemical modification: The Thr is O-glycosylated.
Structure: Rich in Proline. See also AP172. Native pyrrhocoricin is largely disordered in solution with a subpopulation of ordered turns over residues 2-5, 4-7, and 16-19 based on NMR studies. The N-terminal region, residues 2-10, is important for activity, while the C-terminal half of the peptide is important for cell entrance. For the structure of the active region residues 1-10 in complex with the E. coli heat shock protein DnaK, see the PDB link. You can rotate, zoom, and view the complex structure with T. thermophilus 70S ribosomehere in the PDB.
MOA:The peptide appears to target DnaK within bacteria via the N-terminal active region. All-D form is inactive, so not targeting bacterial membranes for killing. However, this peptide may acutally inhibit translationa process in the cell-free E. coli protein synthesis system (Taniguchi M et al., 2016). The macrocyclic derivative incorporates a nine amino acid linker joining the N- and C-termini, which does not adversely affect the antimicrobial potency but leads to a broader spectrum of activity (Eur J Biochem 2002; 269: 4226-4237).

Chemical modification: Position T11 is o-glycosylated and important for full activity. Subsequent analysis showed that S7 may also be glycosylated. Turn elements occur near residues 4-7, 10-13, 17, and 18. At modorate concentrations, this peptide, as well as pyrrhocoricin (AP170), is also active against a few bacteria such as B. megaterium (44% homology to E. coli DnaK D-E helix) and M. luteus, E. coli D31 (MIC 0.5-1.0 uM) (Hoffmann R et al. 1999 Biochim Biophys Acta 1426:459-67). You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structure of Cterminal fragment in complex with E. coli DnaKhere in the PDB. Mechanism of Action (MOA): It binds to an internal protein target DnaK (Eur J Biochem 2002; 269: 4226-4237). Note that all D-drosocin is inactive (so a non-membrane target) and the L form kills bacteria in hours not in minutes. Recently, it is demonstrated that this apidaecin-type peptide and its analog Dros (sequence: GKPRPYSPRPTSHPRPIRV) blocks the assembly of the large (50S) subunit of the ribosome, thereby inhibiting protein synthesis (Krizsan A et al., 2015). Substituting Pro at positions 3,5,10, and 14 with a hydroxylated Pro residues improved non-glycosylated drosocin activity against E. coli and K. pneumoniae. Modification of Pro at positions 3 and 5 increased peptide stability in mouse serum. The new peptides are not toxic to human cells tested at least 600 ug/ml.

More active against a mprF mutant strain (Peschel et al., 2001). Human HNP-1 blocks papillomavirus infection (both cutaneous and mucosal papillomavirus types). HNPs 1-3 and HD-5 have been reported to be present in the female genital tract at levels that overlap those that inhibit HPVs in vitro (Buck et al., 2006). HNP-1 is active against pseudotyped viruses expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins (Xu et al., 2021) as well as Zika virus (ZIKV) (Li et al., 2020). HNP-1 is also active against Leishmania major promastigotes and amastigotesDabirian S et al., 2013. It can also promote wound healing. Enzyme inhibitor: it inhibits protein kinase C (Charp et al., 1988). HNP1 can also neutralize anthrax lethal toxin and other toxins (Kim C et al., 2005; Kim C et al., 2006).
Structure: The 3 disulfide bonds are between residues 2-30, 4-19, and 9-29. S-S bond pattern: Cys1–Cys6, Cys2–Cys4, and Cys3–Cys5. Compared to HNP-2, HNP-1 contains one additional residue (Ala) at the N-terminus. It contains a long stretch of a double-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet in a hairpin conformation that contains a beta-bulge, a short region of triple-stranded beta-sheet, and several tight turns. You can rotate, zoom, and view the tetrameric crystal structure here in the PDB. There are multiple structures for HNP1 mutants or derivatives in the PDB.
MOA1: the L- and D-forms of HNP-1 (crystal structures are true mirror images) are equally active against E. coli (D=L), indicating membrane targeting. However, they displayed different activity against S. aureus. Subsequently, it was found that HNP-1 binds to cell wall precursor lipid II (dee Leeuw et al. 2010 FEBS Lett 584: 1543). MOA2: Although it is a lectin and binds to gp120 and CD4, HNP-1 was found to show inhibitory effects after HIV-1 entry (Wang et al. 2004 J Immunol 173: 515). MOA3: it inhibits non-enveloped BK virus infection by aggregating virions and blocking binding to host cells (JBC 2008; 283: 31125-31132). These examples indicate that the mechanisms of action of AMPs could depend on the type of organisms.
PTM: Arginine can be ADP-ribosylated and HNP1 became less antimicrobial and cytotoxic, thereby regulating peptide properties in vivo (Paone et al., 2002). Anti-toxin: HNP-1-3 protected mice against the fatal consequences of B. anthracis produces lethal toxin (LeTx) (Kim et al. 2005).

Different from HNP1-3, HNP4 preferentially kills the Gram-negative bacterium, probabbly due to a cluster of arginines Arg10, Arg11 and Arg15. This cationic cluster of HNP4 is also important for HNP4 killing of S. aureus, inhibition of anthrax lethal factor (LF) and binding to LF and gp120. In addition, N-methylation of Leu20 to destabilize the HNP4 dimer had little effect on E. coli killing, but significantly reduced the ability of HNP4 to kill S. aureus, inhibit LF, and bind to LF and gp120 (Hu et al., 2019).

A reduced expression is observed in ileal Crohn's disease (Wehkamp J et al., 2005). Three disulfide bridges. Three disulfide bridges. It had been puzzling regarding the role of this defensin. Recent studies revealed two mechanisms. First, HD6 is now shown to control enteric bacterial pathogens in vitro and in vivo by binding to bacterial surface proteins. The peptide appears to be able to form fibrils and nanonets that surround and entangle bacteria. This self-assembly mechanism occurs in vivo, requires histidine-27, according to x-ray crystallographic studies. You can rotate, zoom, and view the crystal structure of the wild-type HD-6 here in the PDB. You can also rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structure of the His27 mutant here. However, you need look at the figures in the published paper for the crystal packing of the monomers. These findings support a key role for HD6 in protecting the small intestine against invasion by diverse enteric pathogens and may explain the conservation of HD6 throughout Hominidae evolution Science 2012.

It also has antibiofilmB activity against S. mutans (Tong Z et al., 2011). Nisin AP, a high content form (95%), can inhibit head and Neck Cancer tumorigenesis (Kamarajan et al., 2015).
Post-translational modification. Shown is the amino acid sequence derived from nucleotide and the actual active form is a translationally modified peptide. There are two di-hydroalanines (Dha): S5 and S33; one di-dehydrobutyrine (Dhb): T2; one lanthionine: S3-C7; and four methyllanthionines: T8-C11, T13-C19, T23-C26, and T25-C28 (Gross E, Morell JL 1971 J Am Chem Soc 93: 4634) (Provided by Torsten Stein).
Structure: For NMR structural studies in SDS and DPC, see Van den Hooven HW et al. 1996. Eur J Biochem 235: 382. You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structure in complex lipid II here in the PDB .
MOA: dual mechanism, i.e. the peptide binds to lipid II followed by forming a pore on the membranes (Science 2006; 313: 1636-1637).
Engineering: Importantly, recent work reveals that the enzymes (NisBTC) responsible for nisin generation may be applied to the modification of other peptides, potentially to improve the protease stability of the template.
Surface immobilization: Nisin has also been covalently immobilized 2011Qi et al. to a multiwalled carbon nanotube.
Production: Phthalyl Starch Nanoparticles as Prebiotics Enhanced Nisin Production in Lactococcus Lactis Through the Induction of Mild Stress in Probiotics (Hong et al., 2020).
AMPs in use: Nisin is a food preservative in use in more than 80 countries (approved by the European Union in 1983 and FDA in 1988). Swiss-Prot P13068.

Activity: subtilin inhibits B. cereus T spore outgrowth at a very low concentration of 80 nM. In addition, f vegetative B. cereus was lysed at 8 ug/ml. spore is a dormant, reproductive cell whereas vegetative cell is any cell that does not produce gametes.
MOA: The peptide antibiotic subtilin acts by formation of voltage-dependent multi-state pores in bacterial and artificial membranes (Schüller F et al., 1989).
Natural variant: [N-alpha-succinyl-Trp1]subtilin has been isolated from Bacillus subtilis A.T.C.C. 6633 (Chan et al., 1993). A total chemical synthesis [N alpha-Succinyl-Trp1]-subtilin is produced later in the growth of the bacterium. After 24 h, the ratio of subtilin/modified form=1:2. This modification reduced antibacterial activity by 10-20 fold.
Recombinant production:bacteria: Stein and colleague improved the production of subtilin in Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633 via adopting two strategies: (1) additional copies of self-protection immunity gene spaIFEG (1.7 fold increase of expression) and (2) deletion of a repressor of subtilin gene expression, leading to 6 fold increase. Interestingly, the major form of the expressed form is succinylated subtilin with reduced antibacterial activity (Heinzmann S et al., 2006).

Activity: An inducible human AMP. Active against E. coli DSM1103 (MIC100 9.4 ug/ml), K. pneumoniae DSM681 (MIC100 25 ug/ml), P. aeruginosa DSM1128 (MIC 18.75 ug/ml), S. aureus ATCC25923 (MIC 4.7 ug/ml), and S. pneumoniae DSM11865 (MIC 4.7 ug/ml) (ref see AP1315). Active against multiple species, including MRSA. It showed synergistic effect with LL-37 in killing S. aureus (Abou Aliwa et al., 2014). More active against a mutant strain from the mprF regulating system (Li et al., 2007). In addition to antibacterial effects, hBD-2 and hBD-3 induce chemotaxis via interactions with CCR2 or CCR6 expressing cells (Rohr J et al. 2010 J Immunol 184:6688-94). It contains three disulfide bonds and a short helical segment preceding a three-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet. These bridges are needed for chemotactic but not antibacterial activity. It is a dimer in solution, which may be responsible for high antibacterial activity. Cf. HBD1 and HBD2 are monomers in solution (Schibli DJ et al. 2002 J Biol Chem 277: 8279).
Structure: Delete the double arginines RR at the C-terminus of hBD-3 or shifting them to the N-terminus reduced peptide activity against S. aureus by 5 fold (Sakagami-Yasui Y et al., 2017). S-S bond pattern: Cys1–Cys5, Cys2–Cys4, and Cys3–Cys6. You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structure here in the PDB.
Mechanism: MOA:bacteria: This peptide inhibits cell wall biosynthesis in Staphylococci (Sass V et al 2010 Infect Immu 78: 2793-800). MOA:virus: Its anti-HIV-1 effect may be due to a direct interaction with virions and through modulation of the CXCR4 co-ceceptor (Weinberg et al 2006 Adv Dent Res 19: 42-8).

Also Active against C. albicans, P. pastoris, C. krusei, A. flavus, and F. solani. Also active against F. graminearum (see ref for AP2428). This peptide is unable to permeabilize liposomes (vesicles). Activity of Rs-AFP1 to Rs-AFP3 reduced in the presence of metal ions. The activity is related to the level of sphingolipid glucosylceramides (GlcCer) in the fungal membranes (Ravares PM 2008 Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 52: 4522-4525) since alteration of the structure of GlcCer or deletion of GlcCer led to poor activity. The Y38G mutant is not active against fungi, but retains the ability to interact with GlcCer, indicating binding to fungal membranes is necessary but not sufficient to kill fungi (De Samblanx GW et al 1997 J Biol Chem 272: 1171-1179). Recently, Aerts et al (2007 J Mol Microbiol Biotechnol 13: 243-7) showed that interaction of RsAFP2 with fungal GlcCer triggers a signal transduction pathway, leading to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and fungal death. These data support the two-step model for the mode of action (MOA) of RsAFP2. Transgenic plants: expression of this peptide in tobacco/tomato improves resistance to pathogens (Montesinos E 2007 FEMS Microbiol Lett 270, 1-11).

Lower levels of LL-37 in serum are correlated with RSV and severity of bronchiolitis and viral etiology (Mansbach et al., 2017). The relationship of human LL-37 with cancer is complex (Reviewed by Wu et al. 2010). While LL-37 could promote cancer metastasis in certain cases, its fragment (FK-16) have been documented to have anti-cancer effects (Li et al., 2006).
Discovery: Molecular formula of LL-37: C205H341N59O53; Mol. Wt. 4493.312; molar extinction coefficient = 0. Discovered in 1995 by three labs (see the ref; Cowland JB et al. 1995; Larrick JW et al. 1995). The precursor protein is human cationic antimicrobial protein-18 kDa (hCAP-18). The mature peptide released by proteinase 3 is referred to as LL-37 (Gudmundsson GH et al., 1996), which is two residues shorter than the predicted form FALL-39 (AP03566).
Activity: Active against bacteria (E. coli. B. thailandensis, A. baunmannii, H. pylori, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, S. maltophilia, P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris, H. influenzae, P. gingivalis, Y. pestis, B. anthracis (D=L), E. faecalis (VRE), S. epidermidis, S. aureus (MRSA) (medium and condition dependent, inactive in rich medium via microdilution), B. subtilis, S. mutans, M. tuberculosis (anti-TB), M. smegmatis, M. bovis, L. casei, L. monocytogenes EGD (MIC 1.5 ug/ml), M. luteus, P. acnes, T. denticola, T. palidum, Y. pestis, A. xylosoxidans, B. suis, F. novicida, F. nucleatum, L. interrogans, Group A streptococcus, Group B streptococcus), fungi (C. albicans), viruses (HIV-1; Herpes Simplex Virus , HSV-1; respiratory syncytial virus, RSV; influenza virus; human adenovirus, HAdV; dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2)), Zika virus; the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) (Brice et al., 2018); Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) (Ahmed A et al. 2019); SARS-Cov-2 (Wang et al. 2021); parasites (e.g., E. histolytica), cancer cells. Antibacterial activity of LL-37 is serum-susceptible and become inactive in human serum due to binding to serum proteins. It inhibits F. novicida biofilms in vitro even at 0.24 ug/ml based on CV staining (Amer LS et al., 2010) (EC50 50 nM). It inhibits biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa below MIC (0.05 ug/ml) (Overhage J et al., 2008;Dean SN et al., 2011). It can also kill sperms, a possible spermicidal agent for developing a potential vaginal contraceptive (Srakaew N et al., 2014). It shows synergistic effect with defensins or lysozyme.
Structure: At an acidic condition, LL-37 is disordered, but becomes tetramer (involving residues 2-36) at elevated pH (~7) (Li et al., 2007). This tetramer is maintained in zwitterionic membranes but dissociated in anionic bacterial membranes (Oren et al. 1999 Biochem J 341:501-513). Upon association with bacterial outer membrane component LPS or inner membrane component PG, LL-37 adopts a long helix covering residues 2-31 with a disordered C-terminal tail. The membrane-bound high-resolution structure of LL-37 is determined by 3D NMR in the presence of SDS or D8PG using 13C,15N-labeled sample (Wang G, 2008). You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structure here in the PDB.
Sunlight and vitamin D, and light therapy: The expression of LL-37 is transcriptionally regulated by vitamin D (Karlsson J et al. 2008), sunlight, and other factors. This might have provided the basis for Niels Finsen' light therapy to treat TB. Indeed, colocalization of LL-37 and mycobacteria element has been detected in macrophages(Deshpande et al., 2020). The administration of vitamin D (25D3) as supplement (leading to cathelicidin expression in epithelial cells) may prevent unitary tract infection (UTI) (Hertting, O et al. 2010). Other AMP inducing factors are listed here.
Bacterial response: Resistance to AMPs is not a general phenomenon yet. However, bacteria have responding genes that can reduce peptide MIC when knocked out. mprF is an enzyme that places lysine on membrane PG to reduce the afficity of LL-37 to anionic bacterial membranes (ref needed). Bacteria also use other means by secreting proteases to compromise the effect of AMPs.
Beyond antimicrobials: immune modulation: In addition to antimicrobial and anti-septic effects, LL-37 also possesses multiple other functions such as chemotaxis (e.g. to monocytes; T cells; peripheral blood neutrophils; eosinophils) via formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2) (Yang D et al., 2000), mast cells via MrgX2 (Subramanian et al., 2011), activates CXCR2 receptor of neutrophils, purinergic receptor P2X7 in fibroblasts, and insulin growth factor receptor in epithelial cells, promotes wound healing, cell differentiation, apoptosis, and immune modulation. In addition, scavenger receptors (SCARB1 (SR-B1), OLR1 (SR-E1), and AGER (SR-J1)) appear involved in immunemodulation (Amagai et al., 2023). LL-37 can also associate with human apolipoprotein A-I, F-actin and DNA and becomes inactive (reviewed by Wang, G 2007). The binding of LL-37 to LPS modulates the signal transduction via the TLR4 pathway, while its binding to bacterial DNA works via the TLR9 pathway.
Post-translational chemical modification: Arginines of LL-37 can get citrullinated (Kilsgård et al., 2012), weakening its ability in preventing endotoxin-induced sepsis (Koziel J et al., 2014). It has been proved that citrullinated LL-37 can be detected when healthy people are exposed to LPS (Al-Adwani et al., 2020). Also, up to four out of the five arginines of LL-37 can be ADP-ribosylated, thereby regulating peptide properties in vivo (Picchianti et al., 2015). LL-37 may also be carbamylated (Koro et al., 2016). LL-37 can be cleaved by multiple proteases such as cathepsins S and K. However, it inhibits cathepsin L (Andrault PM et al., 2015).
Surface immobilization: LL-37 has also been covalently immobilized 2006 Gabriel M et al. to the titanium surface. So are KR-12 (the minimal antimicrobial peptide), IG-25 that corresponds to residues 13-37 of LL-37, and the major antimicrobial region FK-16 (GF-17 minus N-terminus G) (Mishra and Wang, 2017).
Recombinant production:bacteria:Escherichia coli: LL-37 has been recombinantly expressed.
Clinical trials: OP-145 is 24mer derived from P60.4 (derived from IG-24). It is in the phase II clinical trials as a treatment for chronic middle ear infection.
The LL-37 story will surely continue to evolve. Found in multiple species. Also see ALL-38.

The authors found that truncation of the C-terminal hydrophobic tail (BMAP27(1-18)) improved peptide selectivity but had little effect on antimicrobial activity. In addition, BMAP-18 ( i.e. N-terminal 18-residues of BMAP-27) is HIV-active. Further deletion of three C-terminal residues from BMAP-18 led to a peptide (BMAP-15) that is inactive to HIV-1 (Wang, G., et al. 2008. Antimicrobial Agents & Chemotherapy 52: 3438-3440). BMAP-18 has also been shown to Kill Trypanosomatid Parasites [PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2009;3(2):e373].

Animal model:mouse: BMAP-28 has broad antimicrobial activities and confers protection in a mouse model of bacterial infection or sepsis (Giacometti A et al. 2004 Crit Care Med 32, 2485-90). Furthermore, BMAP-28 and its isomers demonstrated anti-leishmanial activities against intracellular L. major amastigotes within a macrophage infection model.
SAR: Interestingly, the D-amino acid form is more active against parasites than either BMAP-28 (the L form) or the sequence reversed form (Lynn MA et al 2011 PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 5(5):e1141). Trucation of the C-terminal tail reduced hemolysis. Of note, a modified peptide (mBMAP-28) was also synthesized by replacing the C-terminal hydrophobic tail (residues 20-28) with a more hydrophilic sequence QATPATRQ also reduced peptide cell selectivity.

Antimicrobial robustness: Activity remains in serum (serum-less susceptible).
Structure: The peptide is helical in either ipid A or 30% TFE based on CD. 3D structure of a 32-residue N-terminal fragment (PDB entry 1LYP) was determined in 30% TFE by solution NMR as a complete and rigid helix (Chen C et al. 1995 FEBS Lett 370: 46-52).

It is a two gene ligation product. RTD-1 is most abundant (~50% of the RTD content; the ratio of RTD1, -2, and 3 are 29:1:2). Total RTD content varied by 3 fold between animals (see ref for AP1074).
Activity: Active against S. aureus 502a (including MRSA), L. monocytogenes, E. coli ML 35, S. typhimurium, C. albicans 16820, and C. neoformans. Theta-defensins are particularly important for antifungal activity of the granule extracts as alpha-defensins are poorly active (Tongaonkar P et al 2011 J Leuko Biol 89, 283-90). It is also active against HIV-1. RTD-1 inhibits human Papillomavirus (hrHPV, nonenvelope DNA virus) infection through a mechanism involving capsid clustering that inhibits virions from binding to cell surface receptor complexes (Skeate et al., 2020).
Structure: It contains three disulfide bonds: 3,16; 5,14; 7,12. The molecule self associates in water in a concentration-depedent manner. Initially thought flexible (PDB ID: 1HVZ), the refined 3D structure revealed a rigid beta-hairpin structure (PDB ID: 2LYF; Conibear AC et al., 2012). You can rotate, zoom, and view the refined 3D structure here in the PDB.
Antimicrobial robustness: Antibacterial activity of this circular molecule is salt-insensitive compared to non-circular alpha-defensins.
SAR: The antibacterial activity of synthetic and isolated forms is indistinguishable. Acyclic RTD peptides are substantially less active against E. coli and S. aureus. Full sequence amino acid scanning of theta-defensin RTD-1 yields a potent anthrax lethal factor protease inhibitor. Both Cys (backbone folding) and Arg (highly conserved R4 and R13) are critical for this activity (Li et al., 2017).
MOA: Theta-defensins are internalized rapidly by target bacterial cells. MOA:virus: it binds to gp120 and CD4, thereby inhibiting HIV entry (Wang W J Immunol 2004; 173:515-520). Wild-type RTD-1 is a moderate non-competitive inhibitor of LF protease (Ki = 365 ± 20 nM) and a weak inhibitor of other metalloproteases such as TACE (Ki = 4.45 ± 0.48 ?M).
Animal model:mouse: RTD-1 showed efficacy in vivo against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS) pulmonary disease (Wohlford-Lenane CL et al. 2009 J Virol 83: 11385-90).

Expression: hBD-1 is constitutively expressed.
Activity:While the reduced form is active against both Gram+ and Gram- bacteria, the oxidized form is only active against Gram- bacteria with little effect on cell envelope (Raschig J et al., 2017). This AMP is a salt-sensitive antibiotic in lung that is inactivated in cystic fibrosis (Cell. 1997 Feb 21;88(4):553-60). hBD-1 is one of the most prominent peptides of its class but despite ubiquitous expression by all human epithelia, comparison with other defensins suggested only minor antibiotic killing activity. Interestingly, it inhibits the growth of clinical S. aureus strains but NOT lab strains. It was observed that hBD-1 from human platelets can cluster bacteria and signals NETs formation (Kraemer BF et al. 2011 PLoS Pathog Nov 7). It is VERY interesting that after reduction of disulphide-bridges, hBD-1 becomes a potent AMP against the opportunistic pathogenic fungus C. albicans and against anaerobic, Gram-positive commensals of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus species. It seems to work using a different mechanism from hBD-3 (mainly on membranes). For a full story, please refer to Schroeder BO et al Reduction of disulphide bonds unmasks potent antimicrobial activity of human beta-defensin 1 Nature. 2011 Jan 20;469(7330):419-23 (APD recommended reading). Apoptosis. This AMP shows synergistic effect with LL-37 or lysozyme against S. aureus and E. coli (Chen X et al 2005 J Dermatol Sci 40: 123-32).
MOA: It kiils C. glabrata by generating oxidative stress and arresting the cell cycle in G0/G1 phase (Kamli et al., 2022).
Structure nmr+x: it contains one helix and three beta-strands linked by three disulfide bonds (NMR: Bauer F et al. 2001 Protein Sci 10:2470, use the PDB link; X-ray: Hoover DM et al 2001 J Biol Chem 276:39021-6; PDB: 1IJV). You can rotate, zoom, and view the NMR structure here in the PDB. You can view the crystal structure here.
Chemotactic: chemotactic effects of hBD-1 is achieved via the CCR6 receptor expressed on immature dendritic cells and CD45RO+ and CD4+ T cells (Pazgier M et al., 2007). The CCR6-mediated chemotaxis surface is defined by the N-terminal alpha-helical region (Asp(1)... Ser(8)) and a few topologically adjacent residues (Lys(22), Arg(29), and Lys(33)).
Channel inhibitor: HBD1 was found to selectively inhibit human and mouse Kv1.3 channels with IC50 values of 11.8 ± 3.1 uM and 13.2 ± 4.0 uM, respectively (Feng J et al., 2016).
Relationship with human diseases High hBD-1 is an accurate predictor of short-term mortality in patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) (Mani et al., 2018). In colonic epithelial cells, hBD-1 is supressed by the EGFR-ERK-MYC axis (Bonamy et al., 2018).

MccJ25 (formerly Mcc25) is the single representative of the immunity group J. Four plasmid genes (plasmid-encoded) are required for MccJ25 biosyntheis: mcjA encodes the precursor protein, mcjB and mcjC encode two processing enzymes to generate mature peptide, and mcjD encodes the immunity protein (McjD), a member of the ABC transporter family. Immunity is achieved by active efflux of the processed peptide. Bacterial mutants resistant to MccJ25 can taken in the peptide via the outer membrane protein FhuA (the iron siderophore receptor) and inner membrane proteins TonB, ExbD, ExbB and SbmA. (MOA): It works by dual mechanism, interaction with RNA polymerase or membrane respiratory enzyme chain(Bellomio et al., 2007).
Old Structure: Originally proposed as a head-to-tail cyclic peptide (Blond 1999). Current structure (2003): MccJ25 has an unusual lariat-protoknot (""threaded lasso"") structure consisting of an eight aa residue ring formed between the backbone NH of residue Gly1 and the side chain CO of residue Glu8 (XXCsb) (Wilson et al, 2003; Rosenqren et al., 2003). You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structure here in the PDB. The 13-residue tail loops back and pass through the ring and locked via aromatic rings of residues F19 and Y20 (see the structure in PDB). Systematic structure-activity analysis of MccJ25 revealed that only three in the ring and one in the tail are important for this peptide production. Furthermore, two residues in the ring and four in the threaded segment of the tail are essential for transcription inhibition (JBC 2008; 37: 25589-25595). It showed prolong effect in an animal model:mouse infection model (Lopez et al., 2007). The crystal structure of this peptide in complex with the bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP) has also been determined (Braffman et al., 2019). MccJ25 binds deep within the secondary channel in a manner expected to interfere with NTP substrate binding.
This lasso fold is used as a stable peptide scaffold for grafting therapeutic peptides to enhance peptide stability (Hegemann et al., 2014).

The level of hBD-2 in human milk is in the range of 2.6-16.3 ug/ml in Latin American women (Baricelli J et al., 2014).
Activity. synthetic: Active against E. coli DSM1103 (MIC100 18.8 ug/ml), K. pneumoniae DSM681 (MIC100 37.5 ug/ml), P. aeruginosa DSM1128 (MIC 25 ug/ml), S. aureus ATCC25923 (MIC 100 ug/ml), and S.pneumoniae DSM11865 (MIC 300 ug/ml) (see ref AP1315). Active against and killed E. coli, P. aeruginosa, A. baumannii, and C. albicans but show bacteriostatic effect on S. aureus. Activity is salt-sensitive. It also shows synergistic effect with LL-37 in controling group B Streptococcus, an important neonatal pathogen (Dorschner RA et al., 2003). Both hBD-2 and hBD-3 inhibit R5 and X4 types of HIV-1 infection in a dose-dependent manner (Sun et al. 2005 J Virol 79: 14318-29).
MOA: Its anti-HIV-1 effect may be due to a direct inactivation of cell-free virions and inhibition viral replication after cDNA formation (Weinberg et al 2006 Adv Dent Res 19: 42-8). Dietary histone deacetylase inhibitor sulforaphane and butyrate induces HBD-2 expression in intestinal epithelial cells (Immunology 2008; 125: 241-51).
Chemotactic. In addition, hBD-2 and hBD-3 induce chemotaxis via interactions with CCR2 (Rohrl J et al., 2010) or CCR6 expressing cells (Yang et al., 1999). IL-17A and IL-17F are most effective inducer of hBD-2 in human airway epithelial cells (Archer NK et al., 2016).
Structure. The 3 disulfide bonds are between residues 8-37, 15-30, and 20-38. The structure (one N-terminal helix and 3 beta strands) was found to be monomer in solution (Sawai MW et al 2001 Biochemistry 40:3810; PDB ID: 1E4Q) but a dimer in the crystal (Hoover DM et al 2000 J Biol Chem 275:32911; use the PDB link below (nmr+x). There are other crystal structures solved in a differnt crystal or for mutants, as well as NMR structure solved by Sawai et al. (2001), see 1FQQ. Note that there are multiple mutant structures in the PDB. You can rotate, zoom, and view the dimeric crystal structure 1FD3 here in the PDB. Such a fold can be imporant for inhibiting the Kv1.3 potassium channel (channel inhibitor). Also, its antifungal structure in complex with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) has been determined (Järvå M et al., 2018). Mutations in these sites ablate PIP2-mediated fungal growth inhibition by HBD-2. You can rotate, zoom, and view the complex crystal structure here.
Potential use. It also has wound healing effect (Otte JM et al., 2009). In this direction, the antibiofilm activity of the peptide can be beneficial (Parducho et al., 2020).

Variant?: In a subsequent work, Xiao Y et al 2006 J Biol Chem 281: 2858-67) cloned a 32-residue peptide, which contains additional LVQRG at the N-terminus compared to CMAP27. Which one corresponds to the native CATH-2 is not yet clear. The additional five residues appeared not to have a significant effect on antimicrobial activity (Dijk A et al 2009 Mol Immun. 46: 2465-2473).
SAR: For CAMP-27, a change of the last Gly to NH2 (amidation) greatly augmented antibacterial activity against E. coli, to a lesser degree against S. aureus, but not against B. globigii (van Dijk et al 2009 Mol Immunol 46: 2465-73). Antibacterial activities of other synthetic peptides: the N-terminal 15 residues are most potent, peptide residues 1-21 and peptide residues 12-26 are weakest; substitution of P by G only reduced activity slightly, but a change of Pro by Leu greatly reduced antibacterial activity. The potent peptides can kill bacteria rapidly in 5-10 minutes. Of interest, peptides corresponding to residues 1-15 or residues 12-26 showed poor hemolytic activity. Xiao et al (2008 J Innate Immu 1:268) also showed that the Pro residue is important for both antimicrobial activity and LPS neutralization. Substitution of the three F2, F5, and F12 residues with W (peptide RWGRWLRKIRRWRPK) further improved antimicriobial and LPS-neutrolizing activities. This peptide derivative inhibits S. epidermidis biofilm formation at 2.5 uM (four times below MIC) based on CV staining. It impairs existing biofilms.

The N-terminus of the peptide contains 1-amino-cyclohexane carboxylic acid (Chex1). This chain then formed a dimer by covalently linking to 2,4-diamino-butyric acid.
Activity: Active against Gram-negative bacteria. It also prevents B. anthracis mortality by deactivating bacterial toxins (Otvos et al., 2014).
Structure: It is of outstanding interest that A3-apo (residues 1-20) can bind in both the forward and reversed mode. You can rotate, zoom, and view the ball and stick structure here in the PDB.
Stability: the peptide showed remarkable stability in 25% mouse serum (half-life 100 min) (Noto PB et al 2008 Protein Sci 17: 1249-55).
Animal model::mouse: Of outstanding interest is that this peptide displayed systemic therapeutic effects in different mice models against E. coli, A. baumannii via mainly intramuscular administration, although intravenous treatment also showed some effect (see the ref). It is proposed that the dimer is decomposed in vivo into the active metabolite.

Active against E. coli ATCC 25922, K. pneumonia ATCC 13883, P. aeruginosa PAO1, and S. aureus USA300 (MIC 3.1-6.2 uM). More active against a mprF mutant strain (Golla R. et al., 2020). In complex with membrane-mimetic micelles, GF-17 has a helical structure and interfacial R23 and K25 were found to be essential for antibacterial activity as well as membrane penetration, primarily against G- bacteria (Wang G et al. 2012). You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structure of GF-17 bound to SDS micelleshere in the PDB.
FK-16 was demonstrated to have anticancer activity in vitro in 2006 (see the ref) and in vivo in 2013 against colon cancer cells (Ren SX et al. 2013). FK-16 shows antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities against a variety of pathogens after covalently immobilized to the titanium surface (Mishra and Wang, 2017).
FK-13 is the core antimicrobial peptide corresponding to residues 17-29 (sequence: FKRIVQRIKDFLR) of LL-37. Reversal of the sequence of FK-13 led to an LL-37-derived aurein 1.2 analog (LLAA, i.e retro-FK13; sequence RLFDKIRQVIRKF), which remained active against E. coli (Li X et al. 2006 Biochim Biophys Acta 1758: 1203-1214). While FK-13 is also active against HIV-1, retro-FK13 is not (Wang G et al. 2008 Antimicrob Agents Chemother 52: 3438-3440). However, anti-HIV GI-20, corresponding to residues 13-32 of LL-37 with the positions of I13 and G14 swapped (GIKEFKRIVQRIKDFLRNLV), showed the highest therapeutic index.
17BIPHE2 was designed based on the 3D structure of GF17d3 (Wang et al., 2014). 17BIPHE2 is active against the ESKAPE pathogens (MIC 3.1-6.2 uM), including E. faecium, S. aureus, K. pneumoniae, A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species.

It inhibited HIV-1 infection in cultured human T-lymphoblast (CEM-SS) cells (EC50 140 nM) and cytotoxicity (TC50 3500 nM), therapeutic index (25) (Ireland et al., 2008). Also, active against E.coli (MIC >160 uM), P. aeruginosa (MIC 40 uM), S.aureus (MIC >160 uM), C.albicans (MIC >160 uM) (Strömstedt et al., 2017). Cellular location: accumulated in vacuole and processed likely by asparaginyl endoproteinase (Conlan BF et al. 2011 Am J Bot 98:2018-26). Structure: there are other PDB entries: 1JJZ, 1NB1, and 1ZNU.

Also Active against P. aeruginosa (MIC 40 uM) and S. aureus (MIC >160 uM) (Strömstedt et al., 2017). The overall fold is important for anti-HIV activity, since the acyclic permutant is inactive. Kalata B1 also has uterotonic and insecticidal activity (natural pesticide). (MOA) An all D-analog is also active, supporting membrane targeting (Sando L. et al. 2011 Chembiochem 12: 2456-62). NMR studies of the ternary complex identified amino acid residues in loop 5 (W23, P24, and V25) and loop 6 (L2, P3, and V4) are important for membrane binding (Shenkarrev ZO et al. 2006 FEBS J 273:2658-72). It binds to phosphatidylethanolamine and leads to pore formation (41-70 A) in lipid bilayers (Huang et al 2009 JBC 284: 20699-20707). Oligomerization on the membrane surface could be important for this process. Note that oxidized forms of this peptide have also been reported. Trp can be oxidized to oxindolylalanine I (oia) or N-formylkynurenine (nfk). The effect of such oxidation on activity is unknown (Plan MR et al 2007 Chembiochem 8:1001-11).

Structure: Predicted to be helical based on the known structure of human LL-37. OH-CATH30 is obtained by removing the N-terminal 4 residues.
Derivatives: OH-CM6 is obtained by further shortening OH-CATH30 by deleting the C-terminal 10 residues followed by mutations. These derivatives are active against indicator and resistant bacterial strains (MIC in the range of 1.5-25 ug/ml). Activity is reduced in the presence of serum. However, the D-form is stable for at least 12 h. These peptides appear to work on membranes as indicated by rapid killing in 60 min (2XMIC) and dye leakage. Both OH-CATH30 and OH-CM6 displayed in vivo efficacy in reducing drug-resistant E. coli burdens in the neutropenic thigh infection animal model:mouse or murine bacteremia model. It also showed protective effects on E. coli induced rabbit urinary tract infection models (animal model:rabbit)( Zhang et al., 2013).

In addition, three rare cross-links were found between the sulfurs of Cys13, Cys7, and Cys 4 and the alpha-carbons of Phe22, THr28, and Phe31, respectively (Kawulka KE et al. 2004. Biochemistry 43: 3385-3395). Such bridges are essential as disruption of these bonds led to an inactive circular peptide. It has a boat-like (loop) structure with a recognized helix.

Activity: Active against B. anthracis (MIC 16 uM), B. cereus, B. thuringiensis (MIC 40 uM), E. faecalis, S. carnosus (MIC 100 uM), L. monocytogenes (MIC 40 uM), and S. pyogenes (MIC 100 uM). Inactive: B.subtilis (MIC 250 uM). It also has spermicidal effect (Silkin L Bioorg Med Chem Lett. 2008 May 15;18(10):3103-6) as well as antiviral effect against herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and HSV-2 (Torres NI et al., Probiotics Antimicrob Proteins. 2013 Mar 1;5(1):26-35; Quintata VM et al. 2014 J APPl Microbiol; doi: 10.1111/jam.12618).

The molecule might have already been perfectly designed by nature (Sanchez-Hidalgo M et al 2011 Cell Mol Life Sci 68:2845-57). AS-48 is a good candidate as a natural food preservative.

Structure: NaD1 itself forms a dimer in the crystal (Lay et al., 2012). You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structure here in the PDB. In 2014, the crystal structure of a NaD1:PIP2 or PI(4,5)P2 complex was also solved. Remarkably, seven dimers of NaD1 (14 momecules) oligomerize into an arch configuration to cooperatively bind the anionic headgroups of 14 phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) molecules (Poon IKh et al., 2014).
MOA: Like RsAFP2, NaD1 is unable to disrupt lipid vesicles. The antifungal activity involves specific interaction with the fungal cell wall (surface protein) followed by membrane permeation and entry of the cell to affect internal targets (van der Weerden et al. 2008 J Biol Chem 283:14445-14452; van der Weerden et al 2010 JBC 285:37513-37520). It is proposed that the peptide enters fungal cytoplasm via he energy-dependent process of endocytosis (Hayes et al., 2018). Evidence for carpet model (Järvå M et al., 2018). NaD1 induces tumor cell death via a non-apoptotic, membranolytic process (Baxter AA et al., 2017).

Chemotactic: It is a chemoattractant for various cells such as CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and monocytes at 10 nM (Deng et al 2005 J Immunol 174:5243-8).
Peptide engineering: The therapeutic potential was explored by peptide design and helix 3-based peptides are active (da Silva et al. 2008 J Antimrob Chemother 61: 1103-9). The L- and D-forms of a peptide corresponding to residues 32-42 showed similar activity in vitro (D=L) (Hamamoto K et al 2002 Microbiol Immunol 46, 741=9). However, the D-form is stable to proteases.

E. coli TldD and TldE interact to form a heterodimeric metalloprotease. TldD/E cleaves the N-terminal leader sequence from the modified MccB17 precursor peptide, to yield mature antibiotic, while it has no effect on the unmodified peptide (Ghilarov D et al., 2017). Escherichia coli sbmA can recognize perhaps the thiazole rings to internalize the peptide which targets DNA gyrase.

Synthetic peptides without the N-terminal Glycine-rich domain are strongly stabilize the gyrase-DNA cleavage complex with icreased potency.

Interestingly, mBD-14 can induce regulatory T cells (Tregs) that tame T cell-driven reactions so that it could perform antimicrobial defense without collateral damage by the adamptive immune system (Navid F et al. 2011 online Dec. 14). mBD-3 appears to play a role in mucosal immunity in the lower urinary tract (Becknell B et al. 2014). IL-17A and IL-17F are essential for the production of mBD-14 to clear S. aureus nasal colonization (Archer NK et al., 2016). It has anticancer effect on lung cancer cells (Hanaoka Y et al., 2016; Phan et al., 2016).

Killing of B. subtilis by either TC appeared to be very rapid. Because TCs were unable to dissipate the membrane potential of L. lactis, the mechanism of TC-mediated killing most probably does not involve pore formation. TC-1 is obtained by truncating 2 residues from the C-terminus of NAP-2. The structure of NAP-2 was determined by both X-ray and NMR (NMR+x). The protein is a tetramer (see the PDB link below) in the crystal (Malkowski MG,et al., 1995). Since the functional form is a monomer, NMR was utilized to study the soultion structure and backbone dynamics of the monomeric form of the protein in the presence of a 2-chloroethanol -water solvent (Young H et al. 1999). While both ends of NAP-2 are disordered, the middle region contains a three-stranded beta-sheet followed by a well-defined helix. A comparative NMR relaxation analysis reveals a less mobile Asp70 at the C-terminus of NAP-2, probably due to electrostatic interactions with the helix portion. In constrast, the C-terminal tail of TC-1 remains disordered. Such dynamics difference between NAP-2 and TC-1 may explain in part the higher antimicrobial acitivity of TC-1 (Nguyen LT et al. 2011). Likewise, insertion of an acidic residue to the N-terminus of GF-17 also substantially reduced its antibacterial activity (Wang G et al., 2012 ). In both cases, one acidic amino acid decreased the membrane perturbation potential of the peptides (Wang G et al., 2005 JBC) and made them less effective to target the negative surface of bacteria.

Animal model:mouse: in DBA/2 murine models of vulvovaginal candidiasis, intravaginal administratioat at daily doses of 0.7 and 1.4 ug LLIII per mouse led to Candida CFU drop to 34% and 38%, respectively, one week after infection compared to the untreated control group. No adverse effects were observed.
Peptide engineering: to increase peptide stability, 1-2 staples were introduced via ring-closing olefin metathesis. The stapled peptides substantially increased hemolysis and reduced antimicrobial activity. Two staples are better than one to increase peptide helicity and resistance to protease (Chapuis et al., 2012).
Surface immobilization: LL-III has also been covalently immobilized via a cysteine added to the N-terminus onto a commercial silicone catheter surface. The surface-coated catheter is antbacterial against E. coli and E. faecalis (Mishra et al., 2014).

3D structure has been determined by NMR spectroscopy. In 50% TFE, the peptide has a helical structure (residues 2-8) with the C-terminal 4 residues GKPS disordered (Cantisani M et al., 2014). See critical residues. Optimized antibacterial activity was obtained by adding a tryptophan residue at the N terminus and by the simultaneous substitution of residues present in positions 3, 4, and 11 with arginine.
Derivatives: Myxinidin 1 (sequence: GIHHILKYGKPS) is a variant of myxinidin where D4 has been changed to H4; Myxinidin 2 (sequence: KIKWILKYWKWS) is a variant of myxinidin with multiple changes G1 to K1; H3 to K3; H4 to W4; G9 to W9, and P11 to W11; Myxinidin 3 (sequence: RIRWILRYWRWS) is a variant of myxinidin with multiple lysines changed to arginines: K1 to R1, K3 to R3, K7 to R7, K10 to R10 (Han HM et al., 2016). Myxinidin2 and myxinidin3 suppress inflammatory responses through STAT3 and MAPKs to promote wound healing (Han HM et al., 2017).

It is actually a S-linked glyco-peptide (Oman TJ et al. 2011 Nat Chem Biol 7:78-80), i.e. a class IV bacteriocin according to the original classification. Sublancin does not react with iodoacetamide demonstrating it does not contain free thiols. However, after treatment with TCEP, four out of five cysteines became accessible for alkylation. Cys-22 glycosylation (glucose attachment) is essential for antimicrobial activity. There are two disulfide bonds (C7-C36 and C14-C29). Such bridges confer superior stability to this peptide (no degradation after storing in water at room temp for TWO years!) (see the ref).
Active against S. aureus and B. subtilis.
3D Structure: Its 3D structure has been determined by NMR (Garcia De Gonzalo CV, et al., 2014). The two helices (residues 6-16 and 26-35) are adjacent to each other and linked via a well-defined loop. You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structure here in the PDB.

It also kills three oral microorganisms (grown planktonically): S. gordonii, F. nucleatum, and P. gingivalis (Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2007 May;51(5):1837-9). WLBU2 also reduced the bacterial burden of S. gordonii and F. nucleatum biofilms. The minimal DNA bundling concentrations of LL-37 and WLBU2 are similar to the concentrations necessary to ensure effective bacteria killing. CSA-13, a member of the ceragenin family, like natural LL37 or synthetic WLBU2 and HB71 peptides targets the bacterial wall through interactions with LPS and LTA. The ability of CSA-13 to maintain its bactericidal activity in the presence of negatively charged F-actin and DNA and the observed additive effect of CSA-13 with rhDNase I suggest that this synthetic antibiotic has potential advantages in treating chronic infection in CF airways (J Antimicrob Chemother. 2007 Sep;60(3):535-45). Animal model:mouse: Intravenous injection of the peptide at 12 mg/Kg can protect mice from death due to i.p, infected P. aeruginosa. For the mice given peptide post-bacterial infection, in the 1 mg/kg group, nine of nine animals died because of Pseudomonas sepsis; in the 3 mg/kg group, only one of nine succumbed to infection and in the 4 mg/kg group, all mice were protected (P < 0.0001) by the peptide (Deslouches B et al., 2007).

Capistruin is endoded by the capABCD gene cluster, where capA encodes the precursor polypeptide, capB cleaves the presursor and is likely to promote the cyclization, capC encodes an enzyme that activates the side chain of Asp9 for cyclization, and capD encodes a immunity protein.

Although papiliocin displayed a broad antimicrobial spectrum, it is especially active against Gram-negative bacteria.
MOA: This cecropin-like membrane-active peptide may form a pore (2.3-3.3 nm) in the fungal membranes (J Microbiol Biotechnol. 2010 Aug;20(8):1185-8). It could also induce yeast apoptosis (Hwang B et al 2011 Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 408: 89-93). The peptide also showed anti-inflammatory activities.

It's also detected in oocytes and in larvae collected 2 and 24 h after fertilization. In addition, the Myt C expression level in hemocytes increased upon treatment with bacteria, implying its role in host defense.
Activity: the longest synthetic peptide residues 1-40, active against E. coli (MIC 32 uM), P-aeruginosa (MIC >64 uM), E. faecalis (MIC 4 uM), S. aureus (MIC 64 uM), C. albicans (MIC 64 uM), and A-brasiliensis (MIC > 64 uM). MBC values are generally much higher. pH-sensitive: The activity is pH dependent. Only when tested at pH 5 was the reduced MytC as well as reduced and oxidized fragments including structural beta-elements able to inhibit Gram-positive and -negative bacteria (MIC ranges of 4-32 and 8-32 uM, respectively). Recently, the peptide was demonstrated to have antiviral and chemotactic activities as well (Balseiro P et al. PLoS One. 2011;6(8):e23140). Activity against a fish rhabdovirus. Possible four disulfide bonds. In contrast to results previously reported for oxidized isoforms of mussel myticins, reduced MytCc was not active against bacteria at physiological pH and showed a moderate antiviral activity against the viral haemorrhagic septicaemia (VHS) rhabdovirus. However, its chemotactic properties remained active (Martinez-Lopez A et al. 2013). Transcriptomic Analysis Reveals the Wound Healing Activity of Mussel Myticin C (Magalí Rey-Campos et al., 2020).
SAR: fragment 1-18 did not show activity till 64 uM; fragment 9-28 only showed activity against E. faecalis (MIC 16 uM); fragment 19-40 was active against most of the tested bacteria although weakly against P. aeruginosa and C. albicans.

In addition, CXCL10 is also active against parasite L. mexicana in vitro (Söbirk SK et al 2013).
MOA: The interferon-inducible, ELR(-) chemokine CXCL10 kills the Gram-positive pathogen B. anthracis through two independent mechanisms: (1) deregulation of peptidoglycan turnover through interaction with the bacterial FtsE/X complex, which does not require the CXCL10 C-terminal alpha-helix, and (2) through membrane disruption by the C-terminal alpha-helix, which does not need the FtsE/X complex (Margulieux KR et al., 2016). These mechanisms nicely illustrate the antimicrobial units in the same protein scaffold.
Structure: You can rotate, zoom, and view the crystal structure here in the PDB.
Synthetic derivatives: using overlapping peptides, it is confirmed that both N-terminal fragment and the helical region can kill bacteria.

MOA:HIV: this inhibition occurs at the early stage of infection and blocks viral attachment and subsequent entry by direct interaction with the gp120 envelope glycoprotein.
Structure: You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structure of the all-beta dimerhere in the PDB. However, this metamorphic protein can adopt two conformations (classic and alternative) and only the alternative, all-beta conformation (dimer) is HIV-active, while the monomer (consisting of 3 strans and one helix) activates the receptor XCR1 for chemotactic effects. The all-beta dimer variant of XCL1 binds to proteoglycans (glycosaminoglycans, GAGs) (provided by ). Residues W55, K42, and R43 are essential for anti-HIV activity. In addition, R18, R35, and K46 are also important for HIV inhibition. Remarkably, most of these positively charged side chains are clustered on the active protein surface, but disociated in the classic chemokine fold, thereby providing a structural basis for HIV inhibition and anti-HIV drug design .
Protein engineering: Interestingly, introducing a disulfide bond between A36C and A49C mutants locks the chemokine conformation to the all-beta dimeric form (dubbed CC5), which is indeed a potent HIV inhibitor with high affinity to heparin (Fox JC et al., 2015).

Structure: There are multiple structures in the PDB solved by X-ray and NMR methods (NMR+x). .
Chemical modification and peptide properties: Heavy glycosylation of the protein modifies protein surface significantly reduces its toxicity, thereby protecting the the eosinophil granule from the toxicity of the stored proteinand. Heavy glycosylation also reduces its aggregation, bacterial agglutination, and membrane disruption properties (). Thus, to be more active, secreted forms are less glycosylated.

This peptide stimulated insulin secretion from rat BRIN-BD11 clonal pancreatic ?-cells at concentrations greater than 0.3 nM without cytotoxicity by a mechanism involving membrane depolarization and increase of intracellular Ca2+ (Ojo et al., 2015), thereby of interest for type 2 diabetes (T2D). Note that the [L28K] and [C31K] analogues are more potent than the parent peptiude. A subsequent study of this group indicates that the peptide Esculentin-2CHA(1-30) retains the insulinotropic effect after removal of the rana box.

Warning: the sequence is a close mimic of the natural counterpart. The natural form is cyclic due to the ester bond between the hydroxyl of T4 and the carboxyl of kynurenine-13 (represented by Y here). In daptomycin, the N-terminus is lipidated with n-decanoyl fatty acid chain to replace the C11 branched fatty acid in the natural form of A21978C1 (Eliopoulos GM et al., 1985). Other nonstandard amino acids include ornithine-6 (represented with K), (2S,3R)-3-methyl-glutamic acid-12 (represented with E), and three D-amino acids at positions N2, A8, and S11.
Activity: Natural form is active against various Gram-positive bacteria S. aureus, S. faecalis, S. epidermidis (MIC 0.125-0.5 ug/ml), L. monocytogenes (MIC 4-16 ug/ml), S. pyogenes (MIC <0.06 ug/ml), S. agalactiae (MIC 0.25-0.5 ug/ml), group G. streptococci (MIC <0.06 ug/ml), V. streptococci (MIC <0.06-4 ug/ml), S. pneumoniae (MIC <0.06-0.125 ug/ml). This is another anionic peptide that is distinct from many of the cationic AMPs. Its activity requires the presence of Ca2+ (calcium) that causes the aggregation of the peptide.

In the natural form, there are multiple Dab (2,4-diaminobutanoic acid), which are represented here as lysines. The molecule is cyclic due to the formation of an amide bond between the amino group of Dab in position 4 and the carboxyl group of the C-terminus. Residue Leu6 is a D-amino acid and the N-terminus is attached by a fatty acid (Polymyxin E1= colistin A: fatty acid A=6-methyloctanoic acid; Polymyxin E2=colistin B: fatty acid B=6-methylheptanoic acid).
Activity: It preferentially binds to LPS of Gram-negative bacteria and disrupts membranes (Moser et al., 2014). Because of such interesting properties, there is interest in developing polymyxin analogs.
AMPs in use: Colistin sulfate: for oral and topical use. Sodium colistimethate (CMS): for parenteral and inhalation routes. CMS is a prodrug which converts to colistin in vivo. It is less potent and less toxic. Colistin, used alone or in combination, is important to treat Gram-negative infections such as CF involving P. aeruginosa. Polymyxins also promote the release of histamine and serve as safe mucosal adjuvants that enhance vaccine-induced antigen-specific immune responses (for example ovalbumin intranasally immunized mice; Yoshino N et al., 2013).
Toxicity: nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity.

Structure: Interestingly, CD spectra suggest a beta structure in liposomes containing aninoic lipid PGs (Balhara V et al., 2013). Note that the peptide is random coil in water, but adopted a helical structure in DPC, indicating structural plasticity.
Design: GL13K is obtained by substituting 3 residues (Q2, N5, and D11) of GL13NH2 with lysines. The PSP (Parotid secretory protein) peptide GL13NH2 (sequence GQIINLKASLDLL), which corresponds to a lipopolysaccharide-inhibiting peptide from LBP, binds lipopolysaccharides (BBL) and agglutinated bacteria. GL13NH2 is a potential dual-function host defense salivary protein with agglutination and anti-inflammatory activity (Gorr SU et al. 2011), but it did not kill bacteria.
Activity: Its lysine analog, GL13K, however, is active against P. aeruginosa (MIC 8 ug/ml), E. coli (MIC 5 ug/ml), S. gordonii (MIC 64 ug/ml) and S. aureus (MIC 41 ug/ml) (Harmouche N et al., 2017).
Toxicity: It has low hemolytic activity.
Animal model:mouse: GL13K protects mice from LPS-induced sepsis (Abdolhosseini M et al. 2012). DGL13K (made of D-amino acids) killed P. aeruginosa in both the G. mellonella model (animal model:wax moth) and a mouse burn wound infection model (animal model:mouse), with bacterial viability 3-10-fold lower than in untreated controls. GL13K also has antibiofilm activity against P. aeruginosa (Hirt and Gorr, 2013).
Surface immobilization: Surface coating (titanium) of GL13K conferred antimicrobial activity and reduced bacteria CFU, a tech with potential application in dental care (Holmberg KV et al., 2013).

Chemical modification: R2, R7, Q9, and W10 are D-amino acids (XXD). The amide proton of F5 is methylated (XXM). The amide of T1 is acylated (XXL). The sidechain OH of T1 forms an ester bond with the carboxyl group of T12 (XXJ), leading to a macrolactone.
Activity: Active against S. aureus (MRSA) (MIC 4 ug/ml), methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MIC 1-4 ug/ml), lab-generated vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (MIC 8 ug/ml), Bacillus spp. (MIC 2 ug/ml), L. monocytogenes (MIC 1 ug/ml), and Mycobacterium spp. (MIC 8 ug/ml). Inactive against E.coli, P.aeruginosa, S.marcescens, and C.neoformans (Panthee et al., 2017).
MOA: Lysocin E interacted with menaquinone in the bacterial membrane to kill bacteria. This is a novel mode of action different from that of any other known antibiotic, indicating that lysocin E comprises a new class of antibiotic.
Synergy: Surprisingly, serum can enhance the activity of Lysocin E. In vitro, human apolipoprotein A-I increases peptide activity. Also, antimicrobial activity of lysocin E is reduced in apoA-I gene KO mice. It appears that both apoA-I and bacterial lipid II can potentiate the activity of lysocin E (Hamamoto et al., 2021).
Animal model:mouse: The EC50 of the peptide (0.5 mg/kg) is even less than that of vancomycin (5.8 mg/kg), a known peptide antibiotic for MRSA treatment. Remarkably, Lysocin E did not display acute toxicity in mice at a dose up to 400 mg/kg. It is a potential lead.

Polymyxin B is very similar (90%) to colistin with a change of F6 to L6.
Activity: Polymyxin B is anti-film of P. mirabilis (Liu MC et al., 2012). It also has antifungal activity in vivo (Zhai and Lin 2013).
AMPs in use: Polymyxin B is administered parenterally in its active form. Overall polymyxin B has superior clinical pharmacological properties compared with colistin or its prodrug (Nation et al. 2014).

Activity: Active against E. coli.
Structure: This is a two-domain beta-KTx peptide. While the N-terminal domain is helical, the C-terminal domain is disulfide bond containing defensin-like. It is the first example of insecticidal toxin in this family. Antibacterial and insecticidal activity is located at the N-terminus, which is less toxic than the full length peptide (Juichi et al., 2018).

Significance: This is an important variant that is responsible for the black coat color of dogs. In particualr, CBD103 exhibits two types of genetic polymorphisms: (1) a variant allele with a 3-basepair deletion in its coding sequence, and (2) gene copy-number variation. The 3-basepair deletion in CBD103 , termed CBD103G23 , was identified as the allelic variant responsible for a dominant black coat color in dogs (Candille et al., 2007). CBD103 G23 lacks a glycine residue at the N-terminus of the mature peptide, and can bind with higher affinity than CBD103 to the melanocortin 1 receptor (Mc1r) on the surface of melanocytes. Due to its binding affinity and high expression levels, CBD103 G23 is thought to displace Agouti, an Mc1r signaling antagonist, allowing Mc1r to signal unabated, leading to the synthesis of the black pigment eumelanin and resulting in a black coat color. Additional details provided by Monique van Hoek. 2/2022.

Antimicrobial robustness: contrary to vertebrate AMPs, host molecules present in serum or pure DNA did not alter the microbicidal capacity of actinomycesin.
Structure: the overall structure belongs to the cysteine-stabilized alpha-helix and beta-sheet (CSab) super-family (deposited in 2013). The structural regions are Helix: residues 8–16 and antiparallel beta-strands: residues 23–26 and 32–35. You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structure here in the PDB.
MOA: It inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis, likely by binding to the precursor molecule membrane-anchored Lipid II.
Synergy: Although at similar concentrations of bacteriocin, oral human AMPs such as defensins HNP1&2 or lysozyme C are not active. However, there is an antibacterial synergy between bacterial and human AMPs. For example, lysozyme may facilitate actinomycesin access to Lipid II by partial hydrolysis of bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan, and HNP1&2 could facilitate the binding of actinomycesin by changing the conformation of Lipid II.
Immune modulation: bacterial AMPs may show lower immunomodulatory abilities. showed that actinomycesin exhibited low immunogenicity and low allergenicity.
Toxicity: It showed low toxicity to human kidney cells and did not influence the function of ion channels expressed in human central nervous system and heart.

Structure-activity relationship (SAR): Similar to Bac7 and Tur1A, the C-terminus appeared to be less important for antibacterial activity against various E. coli strains. VicBac(1-22) showed similar activity to the WT. Peptide 1-16 is also rather active (MIC 4-8 uM) but lost salt resistance (MIC 32-64 uM in 0.9% NaCl). Hence peptide 1-18 may be the minimal region with good activity.
MOA: under the physiological conditions, with the exception of the full-length VicBac, all the shortened peptides lost their activity against Delta(sbmA) and delta(ompF) strains, indicating the same internalization route via SbmA and OmpF but not MdtM. The peptide inhibits ribosome as other Pr-AMPs. VicBac showed a moderate effect on bacterial memrbranes, but NOT the shortened peptides.
Resistance development: it is notable that the full length (WT) did not develop resistance in a 2-week multiple passage experimnet. Surprisingly, the MIC of VicBac(1-22) increased by 256 fold after only 10 passages. This study underscores the importance of teh C-terminal hydrophobic domain in preventing the resistance development (because it allows the peptide to act on different targets ranging from membranes to ribosomes!
Cytotoxicity: both VicBac and the fragment 1-22 are not hemo.lytic till 128 uM.

Structure: determined in water by 2D NMR. FIve Pro and 4 Gly posed challenge to NMR analysis. F22 and Y23 amide chemical shifts at 9.21 and 10.32 ppm, respectively. Wide chemical shift range from 10.32 to 6.3 ppm for the amide region indicates a folded lasso structure. Cloacaenodin has a loop region of 13 amino acids, which is the second largest loop observed after ubonodin. You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structure here in the PDB. Cloacaenodin is unique with a C-terminal serine and 9-membered ring (others with 8-membered ring and a C-terminal G).
Antimicrobial robustness: this lasso is resistant to multiple proteases (trypsin, chymotrypsin, elastase, and thermolysin).
SAR: The C-terminal serine is critical for threading through the ring structure: S24G mutant is unable to do so and this peptide is inactive against bacteria. However, S24A, S24C, and S24T are antibacterial. G1A and E9D were not expressed. Y10A had a drastically reduced activity. V4P favored peptide threading at a cost of reduced expression (1% of the WT).","Cloacaenodin, an Antimicrobial Lasso Peptide with Activity against Enterobacter.","Carson DV, Patiño M, Elashal HE, Cartagena AJ, Zhang Y, Whitley ME, So L, Kayser-Browne AK, Earl AM, Bhattacharyya RP, Link AJ. 2022",ACS Infect Dis. 2022 Dec 15. doi: 10.1021/acsinfecdis.2c00446.

MOA: unlike SMAP-29 or SMAP-18-W, SMAP-18 did not cause any membrane depolarization even at 4 × MIC. Confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed translocation of SMAP-18 across the membrane in a non-membrane disruptive manner by targeting intracellular nucleic acids.
Peptide engineering: L-to-D-amino acid substitution of SMAP-18 improved antimicrobial activity by 2-8 fold (D>L), probably due to the stability against proteases inside bacterial cells (Jacob et al., 2016).
