The difference  between anakinra and the native human IL-1Ra is that anakinra has an extra methionine residue at the amino terminus. It is manufactured by using the E. coli expression system. Anakinra is composed of 153 amino acid residues. FDA approved on November 14, 2001. ",To treat adult rheumatoid arthritis and Neonatal-Onset Multisystem Inflammatory Disease (NOMID).,"Anakinra blocks the biologic activity of IL-1 by competitively inhibiting IL-1 binding to the interleukin-1 type I receptor (IL-1RI), which is expressed in a wide variety of tissues and organs. IL-1 production is induced in response to inflammatory stimuli and mediates various physiologic responses including inflammatory and immunological responses.

The protein has a molecular mass of approximately 19,000 daltons, and is non-glycosylated. The polypeptide  is 177 amino acids in length (the natural IL-11 has 178). This alteration has not resulted in measurable differences in bioactivity either in vitro or in vivo. The primary hematopoietic activity of Neumega is stimulation of megakaryocytopoiesis and thrombopoiesis. In mice and nonhuman primate studies Neumega has shown potent thrombopoietic activity in compromised hematopoiesis, including moderately to severely myelosuppressed animals. In these studies, Neumega improved platelet nadirs and accelerated platelet recoveries compared to controls. In animal studies Oprelvekin also has non-hematopoetic activities. This includes the regulation of intestinal epithelium growth (enhanced healing of gastrointestinal lesions), the inhibition of adipogenesis, the induction of acute phase protein synthesis (e.g., fibrinogen), and inhibition of macrophageal released pro-inflammatory cytokines.",Increases reduced platelet levels due to chemotherapy.,Oprelvekin is indicated for the prevention of severe thrombocytopenia and the reduction of the need for platelet transfusions following myelosuppressive chemotherapy in adult patients with nonmyeloid malignancies who are at high risk of severe thrombocytopenia.

Reversal of these amino acid residues produces a rapid-acting insulin analogue. FDA approved on 1996. ,To treat type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus. To be used in conjunction with an intermediate or long-acting insulin except when used in a continuous insulin infusion pump.,"Insulin is a natural hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas. In non-diabetic individuals, a basal level of insulin is supplemented with insulin spikes following meals. Increased insulin secretion following meals is responsible for the metabolic changes that occur as the body transitions from a postabsorptive to absorptive state. Insulin promotes cellular uptake of glucose, particularly in muscle and adipose tissues, promotes energy storage via glycogenesis, opposes catabolism of energy stores, increases DNA replication and protein synthesis by stimulating amino acid uptake by liver, muscle and adipose tissue, and modifies the activity of numerous enzymes involved in glycogen synthesis and glycolysis. Insulin also promotes growth and is required for the actions of growth hormone (e.g. protein synthesis, cell division, DNA synthesis). Insulin lispro is a rapid-acting insulin analogue used to mimic postprandial insulin spikes in diabetic individuals. The onset of action of insulin lispro is 10-15 minutes. Its activity peaks 60 minutes following subcutaneous injection and its duration of action is 4-5 hours. Compared to regular human insulin, insulin lispro  has a more rapid onset of action and a shorter duration of action. Insulin lispro is also shown to be equipotent to human insulin on a molar basis.  ","Insulin lispro binds to the insulin receptor(IR), a heterotetrameric protein consisting of two extracellular alpha units and two transmembrane beta units. The binding of insulin to the alpha subunit of IR stimulates the tyrosine kinase activity intrinsic  to the beta subunit of the receptor. The bound receptor autophosphorylates and phosphorylates numerous intracellular substrates such as insulin receptor substrates (IRS) proteins, Cbl, APS, Shc and Gab 1. Activation of these proteins leads to the activation of downstream signaling molecules including PI3 kinase and Akt. Akt regulates the activity of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and protein kinase C (PKC), both of which play critical roles in metabolism and catabolism. In humans, insulin is stored in the form of hexamers; however, only insulin monomers are able to interact with IR. Reversal of the proline and lysine residues at positions B28 and B29 of native insulin eliminates hydrophobic interactions and weakens some of the hydrogen bonds that contribute to the stability of the insulin dimers that comprise insulin hexamers. Hexamers of insulin lispro are produced in the presence of zinc and -cresol. These weakly associated hexamers quickly dissociate upon subcutaneous injection and are absorbed as monomers through vascular endothelial cells.

Plasmid DNA transfected into the bacteria encodes for an analogue of human insulin that has a lysine at residuce B28 and proline at B29; these residues are reversed in endogenous human insulin. Reversal of these amino acid residues produces a rapid-acting insulin analogue. FDA approved on 1996. ,To treat type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus. To be used in conjunction with an intermediate or long-acting insulin except when used in a continuous insulin infusion pump.,"Insulin is a natural hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas. In non-diabetic individuals, a basal level of insulin is supplemented with insulin spikes following meals. Increased insulin secretion following meals is responsible for the metabolic changes that occur as the body transitions from a postabsorptive to absorptive state. Insulin promotes cellular uptake of glucose, particularly in muscle and adipose tissues, promotes energy storage via glycogenesis, opposes catabolism of energy stores, increases DNA replication and protein synthesis by stimulating amino acid uptake by liver, muscle and adipose tissue, and modifies the activity of numerous enzymes involved in glycogen synthesis and glycolysis. Insulin also promotes growth and is required for the actions of growth hormone (e.g. protein synthesis, cell division, DNA synthesis). Insulin lispro is a rapid-acting insulin analogue used to mimic postprandial insulin spikes in diabetic individuals. The onset of action of insulin lispro is 10-15 minutes. Its activity peaks 60 minutes following subcutaneous injection and its duration of action is 4-5 hours. Compared to regular human insulin, insulin lispro  has a more rapid onset of action and a shorter duration of action. Insulin lispro is also shown to be equipotent to human insulin on a molar basis.  ","Insulin lispro binds to the insulin receptor(IR), a heterotetrameric protein consisting of two extracellular alpha units and two transmembrane beta units. The binding of insulin to the alpha subunit of IR stimulates the tyrosine kinase activity intrinsic  to the beta subunit of the receptor. The bound receptor autophosphorylates and phosphorylates numerous intracellular substrates such as insulin receptor substrates (IRS) proteins, Cbl, APS, Shc and Gab 1. Activation of these proteins leads to the activation of downstream signaling molecules including PI3 kinase and Akt. Akt regulates the activity of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and protein kinase C (PKC), both of which play critical roles in metabolism and catabolism. In humans, insulin is stored in the form of hexamers; however, only insulin monomers are able to interact with IR. Reversal of the proline and lysine residues at positions B28 and B29 of native insulin eliminates hydrophobic interactions and weakens some of the hydrogen bonds that contribute to the stability of the insulin dimers that comprise insulin hexamers. Hexamers of insulin lispro are produced in the presence of zinc and -cresol. These weakly associated hexamers quickly dissociate upon subcutaneous injection and are absorbed as monomers through vascular endothelial cells. These properties give insulin lispro its fast-acting properties. ","Inappropriately high dosages relative to food intake and/or energy expenditure may result in severe and sometimes prolonged and life-threatening hypoglycemia. Neurogenic (autonomic) signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia include trembling, palpitations, sweat",Insulin is predominantly cleared by metabolic degradation via a receptor-mediated process.,Rapidly absorbed following subcutaneous administration. It is also absorbed more quickly than regular human insulin. Peak serum levels occur 30-90 minutes after injection in healthy subjects. Absorption also differs depending on the site of injection. Aft,"When administered intravenously as bolus injections of 0.1 and 0.2 U/kg dose in two separate groups of healthy subjects, the mean volume of distribution of insulin lispro appeared to decrease with increase in dose (1.55 and 0.72 L/kg, respectively).","Clearance is dose dependent.

Collagenase thus contributes towards the formation of granulation tissue and subsequent epithelization of dermal ulcers and severely burned areas. The action of collagenase may remove substrates necessary for bacterial proliferation or may permit antibodies, leukocytes, and antibiotics better access to the infected area.","Collagenase is a protease that is specific to collagen. The triple helical region of interstitial collagens is highly resistant to most cell proteinases.

This antibody blocks the cleavage of C5 and halts the process of complement-mediated cell destruction. Eculizumab is a product of Alexion Pharmaceuticals and has been shown to be effective in treating paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. Eculizumab was approved by the FDA in March, 2007.","A genetic mutation in PNH patients leads to the generation of populations of abnormal RBCs (known as PNH cells) that are deficient in terminal complement inhibitors (CD-59), rendering PNH RBCs sensitive to persistent terminal complement-mediated destruction.

EGFR is a transmembrane glycoprotein that belongs to the subfamily of type I receptor tyrosine kinases. Although EGFR is expressed in normal cells, the overexpression of EGFR is detected in many human cancers, including those of the colon and rectum. Interaction of EGFR with its normal ligands causes phosphorylation and activation of a series of intracellular proteins that will in turn regulate the transcription of genes involved with cellular growth and survival, motility, and prolieration. Signal transduction through EGFR leads to the activation of the wild type KRAS gene, but the presence of an activating somatic mutation of the KRAS gene within a cancer cell can result in the dysregulation of signaling pathways and resistance to EGFR inhibitor therapy.","Panitumumab binds specifically to EGFR on both normal and tumor cells, and competitively inhibits the binding of ligands for EGFR. Nonclinical studies show that binding of panitumumab to the EGFR prevents ligand-induced receptor autophosphorylation and activation of receptor-associated kinases, resulting in inhibition of cell growth, induction of apoptosis, decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine and vascular growth factor production, and internalization of the EGFR.","Panitumumab was shown to cause skin, ocular and mucosal related toxicities in 90% of patients receiving panitumumab.

It requires Ca-formylglycine for its catalytic activity. This residue is a post-translational modification of Cys53 and conserved in all members of the sulfatase enzyme family.",For the treatment of adults and children with Mucopolysaccharidosis VI.,"Mucopolysaccharide storage disorders are caused by the deficiency of specific lysosomal enzymes required for the catabolism of GAG. Mucopolysaccharidosis VI (MPS VI, Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome) is characterized by the absence or marked reduction in N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfatase. The sulfatase activity deficiency results in the accumulation of the GAG substrate dermatan sulfate, throughout the body. This accumulation leads to widespread cellular, tissue, and organ dysfunction. Galsulfase is intended to provide an exogenous enzyme that will be taken up into lysosomes and increase the catabolism of GAG. Galsulfase uptake by cells into lysosomes is most likely mediated by the binding of mannose-6-phosphate-terminated oligosaccharide chains of galsulfase to specific mannose-6-phosphate receptors.","Galsulfase supplies recombinant-engineered galsulfase, a normal variant form of the polymorphic human enzyme, N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfatase.

Also used for the management of the signs and symptoms of moderately to severely active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in children.","Abatacept is the first in a new class of drugs known as Selective Co-stimulation Modulators. Known as a recombinant fusion protein, the drug consists of the extracellular domain of human cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) linked to a modified Fc portion of human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1. The Fc portion of the drug consists of the hinge region, the CH2 domain, and the CH3 domain of IgG1. Although there are multiple pathways and cell types involved in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis, evidence suggests that T-cell activation may play an important role in the immunopathology of the disease. Ordinarily, full T-cell activation requires binding of the T-cell receptor to an antigen-MHC complex on the antigen-presenting cell as well as a co-stimulatory signal provided by the binding of the CD28 protein on the surface of the T-cell with the CD80/86 proteins on the surface of the antigen-presenting cell. CTLA4 is a naturally occurring protein which is expressed on the surface of T-cells some hours or days after full T-cell activation and is capable of binding to CD80/86 on antigen-presenting cells with much greater affinity than CD28. Binding of CTLA4-Ig to CD80/86 provides a negative feedback mechanism which results in T-cell deactivation. Abatacept was developed by Bristol-Myers-Squibb and is licensed in the US for the treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis in the case of inadequate response to anti-TNF-alpha therapy.","Abatacept is a selective costimulation modulator, like CTLA-4, the drug has shown to inhibit T-cell (T lymphocyte) activation by binding to CD80 and CD86, thereby blocking interaction with CD28. Blockade of this interaction has been shown to inhibit the delivery of the second co-stimulatory signal required for optimal activation of T-cells. This results in the inhibition of autoimmune T-Cell activation that has been implcated in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis.","Most common adverse events (≥10%) are headache, upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis, and nausea.

ACTH. This segment is similar in all species and responsible for biological activity.,For use as a diagnostic agent in the screening of patients presumed to have adrenocortical insufficiency.,"Cosyntropin exhibits the full corticosteroidogenic activity of natural ACTH. Various studies have shown that the biologic activity of ACTH resides in the N- terminal portion of the molecule and that the 1-20 amino acid residue is the minimal sequence retaining full activity. Partial or complete loss of activity is noted with progressive shortening of the chain beyond 20 amino acid residue. For example, the decrement from 20 to 19 results in a 70% loss of potency. The pharmacologic profile of Cosyntropin is similar to that of purified natural ACTH. It has been established that 0.25 mg of Cosyntropin will stimulate the adrenal cortex maximally and to the same extent as 25 units of natural ACTH. Cosyntropin has less immunogenic activity than ACTH because the amino acid sequence having most of the antigenic activity of ACTH, i.e., amino acids 25-39, is not present in cosyntropin. The extra-adrenal effects which natural ACTH and Cosyntropin have in common include increased melanotropic activity, increased growth hormone secretion and an adipokinetic effect. These are considered to be without physiological or clinical significance.","Cosyntropin combines with a specific receptor in the adrenal cell plasma membrane and, in patients with normal adrenocortical function, stimulates the initial reaction involved in the synthesis of adrenal steroids (including cortisol, cortisone, weak androgenic substances, and a limited quantity of aldosterone) from cholesterol by increasing the quantity of the substrate within the mitochondria.

Corticotropin stimulates the cortex of the adrenal gland and boosts the synthesis of corticosteroids, mainly glucocorticoids but also sex steroids (androgens). Corticotropin is also related to the circadian rhythm in many organisms.","As a diagnostic aid (adrenocortical function), corticotropin combines with a specific receptor on the adrenal cell plasma membrane.

Should normally be used in conjunction with an intermediate or long-acting insulin.,"Insulin is a natural hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas. In non-diabetic individuals, a basal level of insulin is supplemented with insulin spikes following meals. Postprandial insulin spikes are responsible for the metabolic changes that occur as the body transitions from a postabsorptive to absorptive state. Insulin promotes cellular uptake of glucose, particularly in muscle and adipose tissues, promotes energy storage via glycogenesis, opposes catabolism of energy stores, increases DNA replication and protein synthesis by stimulating amino acid uptake by liver, muscle and adipose tissue, and modifies the activity of numerous enzymes involved in glycogen synthesis and glycolysis. Insulin also promotes growth and is required for the actions of growth hormone (e.g. protein synthesis, cell division, DNA synthesis). Insulin aspart is a rapid-acting insulin analogue used to mimic postprandial insulin spikes in diabetic individuals. The onset of action of insulin aspart is 10-15 minutes. Its activity peaks 60-90 minutes following subcutaneous injection and its duration of action is 4-5 hours.","Insulin aspart binds to the insulin receptor (IR), a heterotetrameric protein consisting of two extracellular alpha units and two transmembrane beta units. The binding of insulin to the alpha subunit of IR stimulates the tyrosine kinase activity intrinsic to the beta subunit of the receptor.

Activation of these proteins leads to the activation of downstream signaling molecules including PI3 kinase and Akt. Akt regulates the activity of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and protein kinase C (PKC), both of which play critical roles in metabolism and catabolism. In humans, insulin is stored in the form of hexamers; however, only insulin monomers are able to interact with IR. Substitution of the proline residue at B28 with aspartic acid reduces the tendency to form hexamers and results in a faster rate of absorption and onset of action and shorter duration of action.","Inappropriately high dosages relative to food intake and/or energy expenditure may result in severe and sometimes prolonged and life-threatening hypoglycemia.

In non-diabetic individuals, a basal level of insulin is supplemented with insulin spikes following meals. Postprandial insulin spikes are responsible for the metabolic changes that occur as the body transitions from a postabsorptive to absorptive state. Insulin promotes cellular uptake of glucose, particularly in muscle and adipose tissues, promotes energy storage via glycogenesis, opposes catabolism of energy stores, increases DNA replication and protein synthesis by stimulating amino acid uptake by liver, muscle and adipose tissue, and modifies the activity of numerous enzymes involved in glycogen synthesis and glycolysis. Insulin also promotes growth and is required for the actions of growth hormone (e.g. protein synthesis, cell division, DNA synthesis). Insulin glulisine is a rapid-acting insulin analogue used to mimic postprandial insulin spikes in diabetic individuals. The onset of action of insulin glulisine is approximately 15 minutes. Its activity peaks 60 minutes following subcutaneous injection and its duration of action is 2-4 hours.","Insulin glulisine binds to the insulin receptor (IR), a heterotetrameric protein consisting of two extracellular alpha units and two transmembrane beta units.

Activation of these proteins leads to the activation of downstream signaling molecules including PI3 kinase and Akt.

In humans, insulin is stored in the form of hexamers; however, only insulin monomers are able to interact with IR.

Should be used in regimens including a long-acting or basal insulin analogue unless it is used in a continuous infusion pump. May be used with oral antidiabetic agents.,"Insulin is a natural hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas. In non-diabetic individuals, a basal level of insulin is supplemented with insulin spikes following meals. Postprandial insulin spikes are responsible for the metabolic changes that occur as the body transitions from a postabsorptive to absorptive state. Insulin promotes cellular uptake of glucose, particularly in muscle and adipose tissues, promotes energy storage via glycogenesis, opposes catabolism of energy stores, increases DNA replication and protein synthesis by stimulating amino acid uptake by liver, muscle and adipose tissue, and modifies the activity of numerous enzymes involved in glycogen synthesis and glycolysis. Insulin also promotes growth and is required for the actions of growth hormone (e.g. protein synthesis, cell division, DNA synthesis). Insulin glulisine is a rapid-acting insulin analogue used to mimic postprandial insulin spikes in diabetic individuals. The onset of action of insulin glulisine is approximately 15 minutes. Its activity peaks 60 minutes following subcutaneous injection and its duration of action is 2-4 hours.","Insulin glulisine binds to the insulin receptor (IR), a heterotetrameric protein consisting of two extracellular alpha units and two transmembrane beta units. The binding of insulin to the alpha subunit of IR stimulates the tyrosine kinase activity intrinsic to the beta subunit of the receptor. The bound receptor autophosphorylates and phosphorylates numerous intracellular substrates such as insulin receptor substrates (IRS) proteins, Cbl, APS, Shc and Gab 1. Activation of these proteins leads to the activation of downstream signaling molecules including PI3 kinase and Akt. Akt regulates the activity of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and protein kinase C (PKC), both of which play critical roles in metabolism and catabolism. In humans, insulin is stored in the form of hexamers; however, only insulin monomers are able to interact with IR. Substitution of the arginine at position B3 for lysine and replacement of the B29 lysine with glutamic acid decreases the propensity to form hexamers, stabilizes the hormone in monomeric form and results in a rapid rate of absorption and short duration of action.","Inappropriately high dosages relative to food intake and/or energy expenditure may result in severe and sometimes prolonged and life-threatening hypoglycemia. Neurogenic (autonomic) signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia include trembling, palpitations, sweating, anxiety, hunger, nausea and tingling. Neuroglycopenic signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia include difficulty concentrating, lethargy/weakness, confusion, drowsiness, vision changes, difficulty speaking, headache, and dizziness.

In vitro studies have shown that Thymalfasin can influence T-cell production and maturation, stimulate production of Th1 cytokines such as interferon-gamma and interleukin-2, and activate natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity.","The mechanism of action of thymalfasin is not completely understood but is thought to be related to its immunomodulating activities, centered primarily around augmentation of T-cell function. In various in vitro assays, thymosin alpha 1 has been shown to promote T-cell differentiation and maturation; for example, CD4+, CD8+, and CD3+ cells have all been shown to be increased. Thymosin alpha 1 has also been shown to increase production of IFN-g, IL-2, IL-3, and expression of IL-2 receptor following activation by mitogens or antigens, increase NK cell activity, increase production of migratory inhibitory factor (MIF), and increase antibody response to T-cell dependent antigens. Thymosin alpha 1 has also been shown to antagonize dexamethasone-induced apoptosis of thymocytes in vitro. In vivo administration of thymosin alpha 1 to animals immunosuppressed by chemotherapy, tumor burden, or irradiation showed that thymosin alpha 1 protects against cytotoxic damage to bone marrow, tumor progression and opportunistic infections, thereby increasing survival time and number of survivors. Many of the in vitro and in vivo effects of thymosin alpha 1 have been interpreted as influences on either differentiation of pluripotent stem cells to thymocytes or activation of thymocytes into activated T-cells.

The name Preos and the New Drug Application is pending approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).",For use/treatment in osteoporosis.,"Parathyroid hormone is responsible for the fine regulation of serum calcium concentration on a minute-to-minute basis. This is achieved by the acute effects of the hormone on calcium resorption in bone and calcium reabsorption in the kidney. The phosphate mobilized from bone is excreted into the urine by means of the hormone's influence on renal phosphate handling. Parathyroid hormone also stimulates calcium absorption in the intestine, this being mediated indirectly by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. Thus, a hypocalcemic stimulus of parathyroid hormone secretion results in an increased influx of calcium from three sources (bone, kidney, and intestine), resulting in a normalization of the serum calcium concentration without change in the serum phosphate concentration.","The biological actions of rhPTH are mediated through binding to at least two distinct high- affinity cell-surface receptors specific for the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of the molecule, both of which are required for normal bone metabolism. The N-terminal portion of the molecule is primarily responsible for the bone building effects of parathyroid hormone.

Canakinumab has promising clinical safety and pharmacokinetic properties, and demonstrated potential for the treatment of cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS), systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA), and possibly for other complex inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, COPD disease and ocular diseases.","In inflammatory diseases involving Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) is excessively activated and drives inflammation. The protein cryopyrin controls the activation of IL-1β, and mutations in cryopyrin's gene, NLRP-3, up-regulate IL-1β activation. Canakinumab is a human monoclonal anti-human IL-1β antibody of the IgG1/κ isotype. Canakinumab binds to human IL-1β and neutralizes its inflammatory activity by blocking its interaction with IL-1 receptors, but it does not bind IL-1α± or IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra).","The most common adverse reactions involved the central nervous system (headache and vertigo), gastrointestinal system (diarrhea and nausea), neuromuscular and skeletal system (musculoskeletal pain), and respiratory  system (rhinitis, nasopharyngitis and bronchitis).

It is an antineoplastic agent developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb and Medarex for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma in adults. Ipilimumab received FDA approval on March 25, 2011.",Ipilimumab is indicated for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma in adults.,"The pharmacodynamics of Ipilimumab are not completely understood. In melanoma patients receiving Ipilimumab, the mean peripheral blood absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC) increased throughout the induction dosing period. This increase occurred in a dose-dependent fashion in Phase 2 studies. Ipilimumab given with or without gp100 at 3 mg/kg increased ALC throughout the induction dosing period, but no meaningful change in ALC occurred in the control group who received an investigational peptide vaccine alone. Furthermore, ipilimumab binds to CTLA-4 with high affinity (Kd = 5.24 ± 3.62 nM). As a result, ligands CD80 and CD86 are blocked from binding to CTLA-4 with a minimum EC50 value of 0.2 μg/mL.","Ipilimumab is a fully human IgG1K antibody that binds to CTLA-4 (cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4), a molecule on T-cells that is indicated for unresectable or metastatic melanoma. The absence or presence of CTLA-4 can augment or suppress the immune system's T-cell response in fighting disease. Ipilimumab is designed to block the activity of CTLA-4, thereby sustaining an active immune response in its attack on cancer cells. The proposed mechanism of action is indirect, and may be through T-cell - mediated anti-tumor immune responses. ","Therapy with Ipilimumab can result in severe and fatal immune reactions due to T-cell proliferation and activation. These reactions may occur in multiple organ systems, but common reactions include enterecolitis, dermatitis (including toxic necrolysis), neuropathy, and endocrinopathy. Patients should be assessed for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis (diarrhea, abdominal pain, mucus/blood in stool), bowel perforation (petitoneal signs and ileus), hepatitis, dermatitis (rash and pruritus), motor or sensory neuropathy (unilateral/bilateral weakness, sensory alterations, or paresthesia) , hypophysitis/adrenal insufficiency including adrenal crisis/hyper- or hypothyroidism (fatigue, mental status change, abdominal pain, unusual bowel habits, hypotension) and should have liver function tests and thyroid function tests performed at baseline and prior to each dose. Typically immune mediated adverse reactions manifest during therapy, however, a minority of reactions occurred after discontinuation of ipilimumab. In one study of neuropathies, one case of fatal Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome occurred, and once case of severe peripheral neuropathy (Grade 3) was reported. During clinical development of ipilimumab additional cases of Guillain-BarrÃ© and myasthenia gravis have been reported. In severe neuropathy, permanently discontinue ipilimumab, and initiate 1-2mg/kd/day of prednisone or equivalent. In one study, severe or potentially fatal dermatitis (eg, Steven-Johnsons syndrome (SJS) or toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)) occured in 2.5% (n=13). The median time of onset of moderate to potentially fatal dermatitis was 3.1 weeks (up to 17.3 weeks). Treatment of 54% of severe dermatitis cases (n=7) involved high dose topical corticosteriods. 6 patients had complete resolution in up to 15.6 weeks. Permanently discontinue ipilimumab in patients with SJS or TEN, and withhold the dose in patients with moderate to severe signs and symptoms. Mild- moderate dermatitis (localized rash and pruritus) may be treated symptomatically. If no improvement is seen in 1 week administer topical or systemic corticosteroids. In one study of endocrinopathies, severe to life threatening endocrinopathies occurred in 1.8% (n=9) of patients, with all 9 patients having hyopituitarism and some having adrenal insufficiency, hypogonadism, and hypothyroidism. Six of the 9 patients were hospitalized. Moderate endocrinopathies occurred in 2.3% of patients (n=12) and required hormone replacement or medical intervention. The median time of onset was 11 weeks. In symptomatic patients, withhold ipilimumab, and initiate 1-2mg/kd/day of prednisone or equivalent and appropriate hormone replacement therapy.   In one study of enterocolitis in 511 patients, diarrhea of ≥ 7 stools above baseline, fever, ileus and peritoneal signs (Grade 3-5, severe, potentially fatal enterocolitis) occured in 7% (n=34) of patients treated with ipilimumab. Diarrhea of up to 6 stools above baseline, abdominal pain, mucus or blood in stool (Grade 2, moderate enterocolitis) occurred in 5% of patients (n=28). Intestinal perforation occurred in 1% (n=5). Death as a result of complications occurred in 0.8% (n=4). Hospitalization for severe enterocolitis occurred in 5% (n=26).  Grade 3-5 enterocolitis had a median time of onset of 7.4 weeks (with a range of 1.6-13.4 weeks). Grade 2 entercolitis had a median time of onset of 6.3 weeks (with a range of 0.3- 18.9 weeks). Treatment of 85% (n=29) of patients with Grade 3-5 enterocolitis (n=34) included high dose corticosteroids (≥ 40mg/day prednisone equivalent). Median dose used was 80mg/day of prednisone/equivalent for a median duration of 2.3 weeks (up to 13.9 weeks). Of the 34 patients, 74% experienced complete resolution, 3% progressed to Grade 2 severity, and 24% exhibited no improvement. &#13; In treatment of 28 patients with a Grade 2 enterocolitis: 25% received high dose corticosteroids for a median of 10 days; 29% of patients received a non-high dose of corticosteroids (≥ 40mg/day of prednisone/equivalent) for a median duration of 5.1 weeks; 46% did not receive systemic corticosteroids. Of the 28 patients, 79% of patients experienced complete resolution, 11% improved in severity, 11% exhibited no improvement. In patients with severe enterocolitis, permanently discontinue ipilimumab, and initiate 1-2 mg/kd/day of prednisone or an equivalent. Once patient improvement to Grade 1 or less is seen, taper the corticosteroid over at least one month. In patients with moderate enterocolitis, hold dose of ipilimumab, and initiate 0.5 mg/kd/day of prednisone or an equivalent. In another study examining immune mediated hepatitis, AST or ALT elevation of ≥ 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) (severe and potentially fatal hepatotoxicity) was seen in 2% (n=8) of patients on ipilimumab. Fatal hepatic failure occurred in 0.2%. Hospitalization occurred in 0.4%. Additionally, moderate hepatotoxicity (2.5xULN >ALT or AST> 5xULN, or 1.5xULN>bilirubin>3xULN ) occurred in 2.5% (n=13). In Grade 3-5 hepatotoxicity, permanently discontinue ipilimumab, and initiate 1-2mg/kd/day of prednisone or equivalent. Once LFT show sustained improvement taper corticosteroid over 1 month. In Grade 2 hepatotoxicity, withhold ipilimumab. In pregnancy, use only if potential benefit justifies potential risk to fetus (Category C). In studies done in monkeys, severe toxicities were observed including abortion, stillbirth, low birth weight and infant mortality. Additionally, ipilimumab has the potential to cross the placental barrier, and it is unknown if secretion into breast milk occurs. No studies have been performed to study carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, and impairment of fertility.",The metabolism of ipilimumab does not involve the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. Because ipilimumab is a protein it is expected to be degraded into small peptides and amino acids by proteolytic enzymes.,"In one pharmacokinetic study of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma peak concentrations, trough concentrations, and area under the curve (AUC) were found to be dose proportional in the dosage range examined (0.3, 3, or 10mg/kg every 3 weeks for four doses).",Volume of distribution at steady state = 7.21 L,"Clearance was measured to be 15.3mL/hr-16.8 mL/hr.In one pharmacokinetic study examining ipilimumab administered every 3 weeks, clearance was found to be time invariant.

The duration of action was 13.2 hours. The peak activity of NPH insulin occurs 4-6 hours post-dose. Compared to insulin glargine, NPH insulin has a quicker onset of action and shorter duration of action.","The primary activity of insulin is the regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulin promotes glucose and amino acid uptake into muscle and adipose tissues, and other tissues except brain and liver. It also has an anabolic role in stimulating glycogen, fatty acid, and protein synthesis. Insulin inhibits gluconeogenesis in the liver. Insulin binds to the insulin receptor (IR), a heterotetrameric protein consisting of two extracellular alpha units and two transmembrane beta units. The binding of insulin to the alpha subunit of IR stimulates the tyrosine kinase activity intrinsic to the beta subunit of the receptor. The bound receptor is able to autophosphorylate and phosphorylate numerous intracellular substrates such as insulin receptor substrates (IRS) proteins, Cbl, APS, Shc and Gab 1. These activated proteins, in turn, lead to the activation of downstream signaling molecules including PI3 kinase and Akt. Akt regulates the activity of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and protein kinase C (PKC) which play a critical role in metabolism and catabolism",Hypoglycemia is one of the most frequent adverse events experienced by insulin users.,Insulin is predominantly cleared by metabolic degradation via a receptor-mediated process.,"NPH insulin is generally well and rapidly absorbed from the site of injection.

When assayed in the presence of excess of heparin the potency of the recombinant product is not different from that of plasma-derived product.",Indicated for the prevention of peri-operative and peri-partum thromboembolic events in hereditary antithrombin deficient patients,"Hereditary AT deficiency causes an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). During high-risk situations such as surgery or trauma or for pregnant women, during the peripartum period, the risk of development of VTEs as compared to the normal population in these situations is increased by a factor 10 to 506,7. In hereditary antithrombin deficient patients ATryn restores (normalizes) plasma AT activity levels during peri-operative and peri-partum periods.","Antithrombin (AT) plays a central role in the regulation of hemostasis. AT is the principal inhibitor of thrombin and Factor Xa5, the serine proteases that play pivotal roles in blood coagulation. AT neutralizes the activity of thrombin and Factor Xa by forming a complex which is rapidly removed from the circulation. The ability of antithrombin to inhibit thrombin and Factor Xa can be enhanced by greater than 300 to 1000 fold when AT is bound to heparin.","The toxicological profile of antithrombin (Recombinant) administered by the intravenous route as bolus injections and infusions has been evaluated in both single- and repeat-dose studies performed in rats, dogs, and monkeys across a range of doses from 2.1 to 360 mg/kg. The highest doses in the single dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs were 360 mg/kg and 210 mg/kg, respectively. Toxicities observed were limited to transient injection site swelling observed in rats and dogs at the highest doses tested, and increased AST at highest dose in the dog study, both resolved during recovery period. The highest dose in the 28-day repeated-dose toxicity study in rats was 360 mg/kg/day. The toxicity at this dose was limited to transient limb swelling and local injection site bruising and swelling. The highest dose in the 14-day repeated-dose toxicity study in monkeys was 300 mg/kg/day or approximately 7-8 times human dose. Toxicities observed in female monkeys at this dose included internal bleeding, hematological changes and liver toxicity, with one out of three female animals showing multifocal hepatic necrosis. Both sexes showed increased AST and ALK on day 15, with both parameters returning to normal by day 22.

It was granted accelerated approval by the FDA in November 2016. Marketed under the brand name Darzalex by Janssen Biotech, daratumumab is the first monoclonal antibody injection approved for this indication and provides another options for patients with multiple myeloma resistant to other therapies. Daratumumab induces apoptosis of cancer cells by targeting the CD38 epitope, which is highly expressed on haematological malignancies.",For the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least three prior lines of therapy (a proteasome inhibitor (PI) and an immunomodulatory agent) or who are double-refractory to a PI and an immunomodulatory agent. This indication was approved by accelerated approval based on response rate.,"In preclinical trials, daratumumab showed synergistic activity with other multiple myeloma therapies, notably lenalidomide. Daratumumab also causes lysis in other cells that express CD38: myeloid-derived suppressor cells, a subset of regulatory T-cells, and NK cells. Decreases in absolute count and percentage of NK cells were observed during treatment. CD4+ and CD8+ T cell absolute counts as well the percentage of total lymphocytes increased in peripheral blood and bone marrow during daratumumab treatment.","Daratumumab is an immunoglobulin G1 kappa monoclonal antibody against CD38 antigen. CD38 is a transmembrane glycoprotein of many functions, including receptor mediated adhesion, signaling, and modulation of cyclase and hydrolase activity. CD38 is expressed on many cell types and tissues, and highly expressed in haematological malignancies including multiple myeloma tumor cells. By binding CD38, daratumumab causes inhibition of tumor cell growth and induces broad-spectrum apoptosis in multiple ways: by Fc-mediated cross linking, by immune-mediate tumor cell lysis through complement dependent cytotoxicity, antibody dependent cell cytotoxicity, and antibody dependent cellular phagocytosis.","Immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibodies are transferred across the placenta. Due to its mechanism of action, daratumumab may cause fetal myeloid or lymphoid-cell depletion and decreased bone density. The FDA label recommends to defer administering live vaccines to neonates and infants exposed to daratumumab in utero until a hematology evaluation is completed.

It contains no preservatives.,Poractant alfa is indicated for the treatment of Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS) in premature infants.,"Poractant alfa improved lung compliance, pulmonary gas exchange and survival in preterm rabbits.","Endogenous pulmonary surfactant reduces surface tension at the air-liquid interface of the alveoli in the lungs, thus stabilizing them against collapse under transpulmonary pressures. A deficiency of pulmonary surfactant in premature infants allows surface tension to increase to the point where sections of lung collapse and respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) develops. Poractant alfa lowers minimum surface tension to less than or equal to 4 mN/m. This compensates for the lack of endogenous surfactant and restores adequate surface activity to the lungs","Studies on the carcinogenicity or reproductive effects of poractant alfa have not been conducted. Mutagenicity assays were negative. In the case of an overdose with poractant alfa where there are clear clinical effects on the infant's respiration, ventilation, or oxygenation, it is recommended that as much of the solution be aspirated as possible and the infant be managed with supportive measures.

Affecting less than 500 people worldwide, lipodystrophy is characterized by a lack of adipose tissue, fat deposition in the muscles and liver, and metabolic complications such as hypertriglyceridemia, insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus, and fatty liver disease. These metabolic abnormalities are often aggravated by excessive food intake, which is further aggravated by leptin deficiency, a protein secreted by adipose tissue. Administration of Metreleptin results in improvement of metabolic symptoms including improvements in insulin resistance, reduced HbA1c and fasting glucose, reduced triglycerides, and reductions in food intake. Metreleptin is produced in E. coli and differs from native human leptin by the addition of a methionine residue at its amino terminus. It is administered as a once daily subcutaneous injection.

The primary function of endogenous C1INH is to regulate the activation of the complement and contact system pathways. It does this through inhibition of several target proteases within these pathways including activated C1s, kallikrein, factor XIIa and factor XIa. C1 esterase inhibitor has also been shown to inhibit the action of thrombin within the coagulation pathway, and tPA and plasmin within the fibrinolytic pathway. Deficiency of C1-inhibitor permits plasma kallikrein activation, which leads to the production of the vasoactive peptide bradykinin. Additionally, C4 and C2 cleavage goes unchecked, resulting in auto-activation of the complement system.

Deficiency of C1-inhibitor permits plasma kallikrein activation, which leads to the production of the vasoactive peptide bradykinin.

It is sparingly soluble in water. The pH is between 6 and 7. The cationic hydrogenated protamine at a pH of 6.8 to 7.1 reacts with anionic heparin at a pH of 5.0 to 7.5 to form an inactive complex.,"Protamine sulfate is usually administered to reverse the large dose of heparin administered during certain surgeries, especially heart surgery.","Protamine sulphate 1% demonstrates activity neutralising anticoagulant properties of heparin, creating the complex heparin/protamine.
